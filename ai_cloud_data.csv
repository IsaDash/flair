The event washosted by the [Stanford Center for Ethics andSociety](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/), [the Stanford Institute forHuman-Centered Artificial Intelligence](https://hai.stanford.edu/), and the[Stanford Humanities Center](http://shc.stanford.edu/). A transcript of theevent follows, and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4rBh6DBHyw) isposted below. **Nicholas Thompson:** Thank you, Stanford, for inviting us all here. I wantthis conversation to have three parts: First, lay out where we are; then talkabout some of the choices we have to make now; and last, talk about someadvice for all the wonderful people in the hall.Yuval, the [last time we talked](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-yuval-noah-harari-tristan-harris/), you said many, many brilliantthings, but one that stuck out was a line where you said, â€œWe are not just ina technological crisis. We are in a philosophical crisis.â€ù So explain what youmeant and explain how it ties to AI. Let's get going with a note ofexistential angst. **Yuval Noah Harari** : Yeah, so I think what's happening now is that thephilosophical framework of the modern world that was established in the 17thand 18th century, around ideas like human agency and individual free will, arebeing challenged like never before. Not by philosophical ideas, but bypractical technologies. And we see more and more questions, which used to bethe bread and butter of the philosophy department being moved to theengineering department. And that's scary, partly because unlike philosopherswho are extremely patient people, they can discuss something for thousands ofyears without reaching any agreement and they're fine with that, the engineerswon't wait. And even if the engineers are willing to wait, the investorsbehind the engineers won't wait. So it means that we don't have a lot of time.And in order to encapsulate what the crisis is,maybe I can try and formulatean equation to explain what's happening. And the equation is: B times C timesD equals HH, which means biological knowledge multiplied by computing power,multiplied by data equals the ability to hack humans. And the AI revolution orcrisis is not just AI, it's also biology. It's biotech. There is a lot of hypenow around AI and computers, but that is just half the story. The other halfis the biological knowledge coming from brain science and biology. And onceyou link that to AI, what you get is the ability to hack humans. And maybeIâ€™ll explain what it means, the ability to hack humans: to create an algorithmthat understands me better than I understand myself, and can thereforemanipulate me, enhance me, or replace me. And this is something that ourphilosophical baggage and all our belief in, you know, human agency and freewill, and the customer is always right, and the voter knows best, it justfalls apart once you have this kind of ability. **NT:** Once you have this kind of ability, and it's used to manipulate orreplace you, not if it's used to enhance you? **YNH:** Also when itâ€™s used to enhance you, the question is, who decideswhat is a good enhancement and what is a bad enhancement? So our immediately,our immediate fallback position is to fall back on the traditional humanistideas, that the customer is always right, the customers will choose theenhancement. Or the voter is always right, the voters will vote, there will bea political decision about the enhancement. Or if it feels good, do it. Weâ€™lljust follow our heart, weâ€™ll just listen to ourselves. None of this works whenthere is a technology to hack humans on a large scale. You can't trust yourfeelings, or the voters, or the customers on that. The easiest people tomanipulate are the people who believe in free will, because they think theycannot be manipulated. So how do you how do you decide what to enhance if, andthis is a very deep ethical and philosophical questionâ€”again that philosophershave been debating for thousands of yearsâ€”what is good? What are the goodqualities we need to enhance? So if you can't trust the customer, if you can'ttrust the voter, if you can't trust your feelings, who do you trust? What doyou go by? **NT:** All right, Fei-Fei, you have a PhD, you have a CS degree, youâ€™re aprofessor at Stanford, does B times C times D equals HH? Is Yuvalâ€™s theory theright way to look at where we're headed? **Fei-Fei Li:** Wow. What a beginning! Thank you, Yuval. One of thethingsâ€”I've been reading Yuvalâ€™s books for the past couple of years andtalking to youâ€”and I'm very envious of philosophers now because they canpropose questions but they don't have to answer them. Now as an engineer andscientist, I feel like we have to now [solve thecrisis](https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-kai-fu-lee-fei-fei-li-artificial-intelligence/). And I'm very thankful that Yuval, among other people, haveopened up this really important question for us. When you said the AI crisis,I was sitting there thinking, this is a field I loved and feel passionateabout and researched for 20 years, and that was just a scientific curiosity ofa young scientist entering PhD in AI. What happened that 20 years later it hasbecome a crisis? And it actually speaks of the evolution of AI that, that gotme [where I am today](https://www.wired.com/story/fei-fei-li-ai-care-more-about-humans/) and got my colleagues at Stanford where we are today withHuman-Centered AI, is that this is a transformative technology. It's a nascenttechnology. It's still a budding science compared to physics, chemistry,biology, but with the power of data, computing, and the kind of diverse impactAI is making, it is, like you said, is touching human lives and business inbroad and deep ways. And responding to those kinds of questions and crisisthat's facing humanity, I think one of the proposed solutions, that Stanfordis making an effort about is, can we reframe the education, the research andthe dialog of AI and technology in general in a [human-centeredway](https://www.wired.com/story/fei-fei-li-artificial-intelligence-humanity/)? We're not necessarily going to find a solution today, but can weinvolve the humanists, the philosophers, the historians, the politicalscientists, the economists, the ethicists, the legal scholars, theneuroscientists, the psychologists, and many more other disciplines into thestudy and development of AI in the next chapter, in the next phase.> ""Maybe I can try and formulate an equation to explain what's happening. Andthe equation is: B times C times D equals HH, which means biological knowledgemultiplied by computing power, multiplied by data equals the ability to hackhumans.""Yuval Noah Harari **NT:** Don't be so certain we're not going to get an answer today. I've gottwo of the smartest people in the world glued to their chairs, and I've got 72more minutes. So let's let's give it a shot. **FL:** He said we have thousands of years! **NT:** Let me go a little bit further on Yuvalâ€™s opening statement. Thereare a lot of crises about AI that people talk about, right? They talk about AIbecoming conscious and what will that mean. They talk about [jobdisplacement](https://www.wired.com/story/robots-will-take-jobs-from-men-young-minorities/); they talk about [biases.](https://www.wired.com/story/the-real-reason-tech-struggles-with-algorithmic-bias/) And Yuval has very clearlylaid out what he thinks is the most important one, which is the combination ofbiology plus computing plus data leading to hacking. Is that specific concernwhat people who are thinking about AI should be focused on? **FL:** Absolutely. So any technology humanity has created starting with fireis a double-edged sword. So it can bring improvements to life, to work, and tosociety, but it can bring the perils, and AI has the perils. You know, I wakeup every day worried about the [diversity, inclusion issue inAI](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/melinda-gates-and-fei-fei-li-want-to-liberate-ai-from-guys-with-hoodies/). We worry about fairness or the lack offairness, privacy, the labor market. So absolutely we need to be concerned andbecause of that, we need to expand the research, and the development ofpolicies and the dialog of AI beyond just the codes and the products intothese human rooms, into the societal issues. So I absolutely agree with you onthat, that this is the moment to open the dialog, to open the research inthose issues. **NT:** Okay. **YNH:** Even though I will just say that again, part of my fear is thedialog. I don't fear AI experts talking with philosophers, I'm fine with that.Historians, good. Literary critics, wonderful. I fear the moment you starttalking with biologists. That's my biggest fear. When you and the biologistsrealize, â€œHey, we actually have a common language. And we can do thingstogether.â€ù And that's when the really scary things, I thinkâ€_ **FL:** Can you elaborate on what is scaring you? That we talk to biologists? **YNH:** That's the moment when you can really hack human beings, not bycollecting data about our search words or our purchasing habits, or where dowe go about town, but you can actually start peering inside, and collect datadirectly from our hearts and from our brains. **FL:** Okay, can I be specific? First of all the birth of AI is AIscientists talking to biologists, [specificallyneuroscientists](https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/), right. The birth of AI is very muchinspired by what the brain does. Fast forward to 60 years later, today's AI ismaking great [improvements in healthcare](https://www.wired.com/story/health-care-is-hemorrhaging-data-ai-is-here-to-help/). There's a lot of data from ourphysiology and pathology being collected and using machine learning to helpus. But I feel like you're talking about something else. **YNH:** That's part of it. I mean, if there wasn't a great promise in thetechnology, there would also be no danger because nobody would go along thatpath. I mean, obviously, there are enormously beneficial things that AI can dofor us, especially when it is linked with biology. We are about to get thebest healthcare in the world, in history, and the cheapest and available forbillions of people by their smartphones. And this is why it is almostimpossible to resist the temptation. And with all the [issues ofprivacy](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-personal-data-collection/),if you have a big battle between privacy and health, health is likely to winhands down. So I fully agree with that. And you know, my job as a historian,as a philosopher, as a social critic is to point out the dangers in that.Because, especially in Silicon Valley, people are very much familiar with theadvantages, but they don't like to think so much about the dangers. And thebig danger is what happens when you can hack the brain and that can serve notjust your healthcare provider, that can serve so many things for a crazydictator. **NT:** Let's focus on what it means to hack the brain. Right now, in someways my brain is hacked, right? There's an allure of this device, it wants meto check it constantly, like my brain has been a little bit hacked. Yourshasn't because you meditate two hours a day, but mine has and probably most ofthese people have. But what exactly is the future brain hacking going to bethat it isn't today? **YNH:** Much more of the same, but on a much larger scale. I mean, the pointwhen, for example, more and more of your personal decisions in life are beingoutsourced to an algorithm that is just so much better than you. So you know,you have we have two distinct dystopias that kind of mesh together. We havethe dystopia of surveillance capitalism, in which there is no like Big Brotherdictator, but more and more of your decisions are being made by an algorithm.And it's not just decisions about what to eat or where to shop, but decisionslike where to work and where to study, and whom to date and whom to marry andwhom to vote for. It's the same logic. And I would be curious to hear if youthink that there is anything in humans which is by definition unhackable. Thatwe can't reach a point when the algorithm can make that decision better thanme. So that's one line of dystopia, which is a bit more familiar in this partof the world. And then you have the full fledged [dystopia of a totalitarianregime](https://www.wired.com/story/mortal-danger-chinas-push-into-ai/) basedon a total surveillance system. Something like the totalitarian regimes thatwe have seen in the 20th century, but augmented with biometric sensors and theability to basically track each and every individual 24 hours a day.And you know, which in the days of Stalin or Hitler was absolutely impossiblebecause they didn't have the technology, but maybe might be possible in 20years, 30 years. So, we can choose which dystopia to discuss but they are veryclose... **NT:** Let's choose the liberal democracy dystopia. Fei-Fei, do you want toanswer Yuvalâ€™s specific question, which is, Is there something in Dystopia A,liberal democracy dystopia, is there something endemic to humans that cannotbe hacked? **FL:** So when you asked me that question, just two minutes ago, the firstword that came to my mind is Love. Is love hackable? **YNH:** Ask Tinder, I donâ€™t know. **FL:** Dating! **YNH:** That's a defenseâ€_ **FL:** Dating is not the entirety of love, I hope. **YNH:** But the question is, which kind of love are you referring to? ifyou're referring to Greek philosophical love or the loving kindness ofBuddhism, that's one question, which I think is much more complicated. If youare referring to the biological, mammalian courtship rituals, then I thinkyes. I mean, why not? Why is it different from anything else that is happeningin the body? **FL:** But humans are humans because we'reâ€”there's some part of us that isbeyond the mammalian courtship, right? Is that part hackable? **YNH:** So that's the question. I mean, you know, in most science fictionbooks and movies, they give your answer. When the extraterrestrial evil robotsare about to conquer planet Earth, and nothing can resist them, resistance isfutile, at the very last moment, humans win because the robots donâ€™tunderstand love. **FL:** The last moment is one heroic white dude that saves us. But okay sothe two dystopias, I do not have answers to the two dystopias. But what I wantto keep saying is, this is precisely why this is the moment that we need toseek for solutions. This is precisely why this is the moment that we believethe new chapter of AI needs to be written by cross-pollinating efforts fromhumanists, social scientists, to business leaders, to civil society, togovernments, to come at the same table to have that multilateral andcooperative conversation. I think you really bring out the urgency and theimportance and the scale of this potential crisis. But I think, in the face ofthat, we need to act.> ""The easiest people to manipulate are the people who believe in free will,because they think they cannot be manipulated.""Yuval Noah Harari **YNH:** Yeah, and I agree that we need cooperation that we need much closercooperation between engineers and philosophers or engineers and historians.And also from a philosophical perspective, I think there is somethingwonderful about engineers, philosophicallyâ€” **FL:** Thank you! **YNH:** â€” that they really cut the bullshit. I mean, philosophers can talkand talk, you know, in cloudy and flowery metaphors, and then the engineerscan really focus the question. Like I just had a discussion the other day withan engineer from Google about this, and he said, â€œOkay, I know how to maximizepeople's time on the website. If somebody comes to me and tells me, â€˜Look,your job is to maximize time on this application.â€™ I know how to do it becauseI know how to measure it. But if somebody comes along and tells me, â€˜Well, youneed to maximize human flourishing, or you need to maximize universal love.â€™ Idon't know what it means.â€ù So the engineers go back to the philosophers andask them, â€œWhat do you actually mean?â€ù Which, you know, a lot of philosophicaltheories collapse around that, because they can't really explain thatâ€”and weneed this kind of collaboration. **FL:** Yeah. We need an equation for that. **NT:** But Yuval, is Fei-Fei right? If we can't explain and we can't codelove, can artificial intelligence ever recreate it, or is it somethingintrinsic to humans that the machines will never emulate? **YNH:** I don't think that machines will feel love. But you don'tnecessarily need to feel it, in order to be able to hack it, to monitor it, topredict it, to manipulate it. So machines donâ€™t like to play Candy Crush, butthey can stillâ€” **NT:** So you think this device, in some future where it's infinitely morepowerful than it is right now, it could make me fall in love with somebody inthe audience? **YNH:** That goes to the question of consciousness and mind, and I don'tthink that we have the understanding of what consciousness is to answer thequestion whether a non-organic consciousness is possible or is not possible, Ithink we just don't know. But again, the bar for hacking humans is much lower.The machines don't need to have consciousness of their own in order to predictour choices and manipulate our choices. If you accept that something like loveis in the end and biological process in the body, if you think that AI canprovide us with wonderful healthcare, by being able to monitor and predictsomething like the flu, or something like cancer, what's the essentialdifference between flu and love? In the sense of is this biological, and thisis something else, which is so separated from the biological reality of thebody, that even if we have a machine that is capable of monitoring orpredicting flu, it still lacks something essential in order to do the samething with love. **FL:** So I want to make two comments and this is where my engineering, youknow, personally speaking, weâ€™re making two very important assumptions in thispart of the conversation. One is that AI is so omnipotent, that it's achievedto a state that it's beyond predicting anything physical, it's getting to theconsciousness level, itâ€™s getting to even the ultimate love level ofcapability. And I do want to make sure that we recognize that we're very,very, very [far from that](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-teach-artificial-intelligence-common-sense/). This technology is still very nascent.Part of the concern I have about today's AI is that super-hyping of itscapability. So I'm not saying that that's not a valid question. But I thinkthat part of this conversation is built upon that assumption that thistechnology has become that powerful and I don't even know how many decades weare from that. Second related assumption, I feel our conversation is beingbased on this that we're talking about the world or state of the world thatonly that powerful AI exists, or that small group of people who have producedthe powerful AI and is intended to hack humans exists. But in fact, our humansociety is so complex, there's so many of us, right? I mean humanity in itshistory, have faced so much technology if we left it in the hands of a badplayer alone, without any regulation, multinational collaboration, rules,laws, moral codes, that technology could have, maybe not hacked humans, butdestroyed humans or hurt humans in massive ways. It has happened, but by andlarge, our society in a historical view is moving to a more civilized andcontrolled state. So I think it's important to look at that greater societyand bring other players and people into this dialog. So we don't talk likethere's only this omnipotent AI deciding it's gonna hack everything to theend. And that brings me to your topic that in addition to hacking humans atthat level that you're talking about, there are some very immediate concernsalready: diversity, privacy, labor, legal changes, you know, internationalgeopolitics. And I think it's, it's critical to to tackle those now. **NT:** I love talking to AI researchers, because five years ago, all the AIresearchers were saying _it's much more powerful than you think_. And nowthey're like, _it's not as powerful as you think_. Alright, so I'll just letme askâ€” **FL:** Itâ€™s because five years ago, you had no idea what AI is, now you'reextrapolating too much. **NT:** I didn't say it was wrong. I just said it was the thing. I want to gointo what you just said. But before we do that, I want to take one questionhere from the audience, because once we move into the second section weâ€™ll beable to answer it. So the question is for Yuval, How can we avoid theformation of AI powered digital dictatorships? So how do we avoid dystopianumber two, let's enter that. And then let's go, Fei-Fei, into what we can doright now, not what we can do in the future. **YNH:** The key issue is how to regulate the [ownership ofdata](https://www.wired.com/story/should-big-tech-own-our-personal-data/).Because we won't stop research in biology, and we won't stop researchingcomputer science and AI. So from the three components of biological knowledge,computing power and data, I think data is is the easiest, and it's also verydifficult, but still the easiest kind to regulate, to protect. Letâ€™s placesome protections there. And there are efforts [now beingmade](https://www.wired.com/story/how-gdpr-affects-you/). And they are notjust political efforts, but you know, also philosophical efforts to reallyconceptualize, What does it mean to own data or to regulate the ownership ofdata? Because we have a fairly good understanding of what it means to ownland. We had thousands of years of experience with that. We have a very poorunderstanding of what it what it actually means to own data and how toregulate it. But this is the very important front that we need to focus on inorder to prevent the worst dystopian outcomes.And I agree that AI is not nearly as powerful as some people imagine. But thisis why I think we need to place the bar low, to reach a critical threshold. Wedon't need the AI to know us perfectly, which will never happen. We just needthe AI to know us better than we know ourselves, which is not so difficultbecause most people don't know themselves very well and often make hugemistakes in critical decisions. So whether it's finance or career or lovelife, to have this shifting authority from humans to algorithm, they can stillbe terrible. But as long as they are a bit less terrible than us, theauthority will shift to them. **NT:** In your book, you tell a very illuminating story about your own selfand your own coming to terms with who you are and how you could bemanipulated. Will you tell that story here about coming to terms with yoursexuality and the story you told about Coca-Cola in your book? Because I thinkthat will make it clear what you mean here very well. **YNH:** Yes. So I I said, I only realized that I was gay when I was 21. AndI look back at the time and I was I don't know 15, 17 and it should have beenso obvious. It's not like Iâ€™m a stranger. I'm with myself 24 hours a day. AndI just don't notice any of like the screaming signs that are saying, â€œYou aregay.â€ù And I don't know how, but the fact is, I missed it. Now in AI, even avery stupid AI today, will not miss it. **FL:** Iâ€™m not so sure! **YNH:** So imagine, this is not like a science fiction scenario of a centuryfrom now, this can happen today that you can write all kinds of algorithmsthat, you know, they're not perfect, but they are still better, say, than theaverage teenager. And what does it mean to live in a world in which you learnabout something so important about yourself from an algorithm? What does itmean, what happens if the algorithm doesn't share the information with you,but it shares the information with advertisers? Or with governments? So if youwant to, and I think we should, go down from the cloud, the heights, of youknow, the extreme scenarios, to the practicalities of day-to-day life. This isa good example, because this is already happening. **NT:** Well, let's take the elevator down to the more conceptual level.Let's talk about what we can do today, as we think about the risks of AI, thebenefits of AI, and tell us you know, sort of your your punch list of what youthink the most important things we should be thinking about with AI are. **FL:** Oh boy, there's so many things we could do today. And I cannot agreemore with Yuval, that this is such an important topic. Again, I'm gonna try tospeak about all the efforts that have been made at Stanford because I thinkthis is a good representation of what we believed are so many efforts we cando. So in human-centered AI, in which this is the overall theme, we believethat the next chapter of AI should be human-centered, we believe in threemajor principles. One principle is to invest in the next generation of AItechnology that reflects more of the kind of human intelligence we would like.I was just thinking about your comment about as dependence on data and how thepolicy and governance of data should emerge in order to regulate and governthe AI impact. Well, we should be developing technology that can explain AI,we call it explainable AI, or AI interpretability studies; we should befocusing on technology that has a more nuanced understanding of humanintelligence. We should be investing in the development of less data-dependentAI technology, that will take into considerations of intuition, knowledge,creativity and other forms of human intelligence. So that kind of humanintelligence inspired AI is one of our principles.The second principle is to, again, welcome in the kind of multidisciplinarystudy of AI. Cross-pollinating with economics, with ethics, with law, withphilosophy, with history, cognitive science and so on. Because there is somuch more we need to understand in terms of a social, human, anthropological,ethical impact. And\ we cannot possibly do this alone as technologists. Someof us shouldn't even be doing this. Itâ€™s the ethicists, philosophers whoshould participate and work with us on these issues. So that's the secondprinciple. And within this, we work with policymakers. We convene the kind ofdialogs of multilateral stakeholders.Then the third, last but not least, I think, Nick, you said that at the verybeginning of this conversation, that we need to promote the human-enhancingand collaborative and argumentative aspect of this technology. You have apoint. Even there, it can become manipulative. But we need to start with thatsense of alertness, understanding, but still promote the kind of benevolentapplication and design of this technology. At least, these are the threeprinciples that Stanfordâ€™s Human-centered AI Institute is based on. And I justfeel very proud, within the short few months since the birth of thisinstitute, there are more than 200 faculty involved on this campus in thiskind of research, dialog, study, education, and that number is still growing. **NT:** Of those three principles, let's start digging into them. So let's goto number one, explainability, because this is a really interesting debate inartificial intelligence. So there's some practitioners who say you should havealgorithms that can explain what they did and the choices they made. Soundseminently sensible. But how do you do that? I make all kinds of decisions thatI can't entirely explain. Like, why did I hire this person, not that person? Ican tell a story about why I did it. But I don't know for sure. If we don'tknow ourselves well enough to always be able to truthfully and fully explainwhat we did, how can we expect a computer, using AI, to do that? And if wedemand that here in the West, then there are other parts of the world thatdon't demand that who may be able to move faster. So why don't I ask you thefirst part of that question, and Yuval all the second part of that question.So the first part is, can we actually get explainability if it's super hardeven within ourselves? **FL:** Well, it's pretty hard for me to multiply two digits, but, you know,computers can do that. So the fact that something is hard for humans doesn'tmean we shouldn't try to get the machines to do it. Especially, you know,after all these algorithms are based on very simple mathematical logic.Granted, we're dealing with neural networks these days that have millions ofnodes and billions of connections. So explainability is actually tough. It'songoing research. But I think this is such fertile ground. And it's socritical when it comes to healthcare decisions, financial decisions, legaldecisions. There's so many scenarios where this technology can be potentiallypositively useful, but with that kind of explainable capability, so we've gotto try and I'm pretty confident with a lot of smart minds out there, this is acrackable thing.On top of that, I think you have a point that if we have technology that canexplain the decision-making process of algorithms, it makes it harder for itto manipulate and cheat. Right? It's a technical solution, not the entirety ofthe solution, that will contribute to the clarification of what thistechnology is doing. **YNH:** But because, presumably, the AI makes decisions in a radicallydifferent way than humans, then even if the AI explains its logic, the fear isit will make absolutely no sense to most humans. Most humans, when they areasked to explain a decision, they tell a story in a narrative form, which mayor may not reflect what is actually happening within them. In many cases, itdoesn't reflect, it's just a made up rationalization and not the real thing.Now an AI could be much different than a human in telling me, like I appliedto the bank for loans. And the bank says no. And I asked why not? And the banksays okay, we will ask our AI. And the AI gives this extremely longstatistical analysis based not on one or two salient feature of my life, buton 2,517 different data points, which it took into account and gave differentweights. And why did you give this this weight? And why did you give... Oh,there is another book about that. And most of the data points to a human wouldseem completely irrelevant. You applied for a loan on Monday, and not onWednesday, and the AI discovered that for whatever reason, it's after theweekend, whatever, people who apply for loans on a Monday are 0.075 percentless likely to repay the loan. So it goes into into the equation. And I getthis book of the real explanation. And finally, I get a real explanation. It'snot like sitting with a human banker that just bullshits me. **FL:** So are you rooting for AI? Are you saying AI is good in this case? **YNH:** In many cases, yes. I mean, I think in many cases, it's two sides ofthe coin. I think that in many ways, the AI in this scenario will be animprovement over the human banker. Because for example, you can really knowwhat the decision is based on presumably, right, but it's based on somethingthat I as a human being just cannot grasp. I just don'tâ€”I know how to dealwith simple narrative stories. I didn't give you a loan because you're gay.That's not good. Or because you didn't repay any of your previous loans. Okay,I can understand that. But my mind doesn't know what to do with the realexplanation that the AI will give, which is just this crazy statistical thingâ€_> ""Part of the concern I have about today's AI is that super-hyping of itscapability. Part of this conversation is built upon that assumption that thistechnology has become that powerful and I don't even know how many decades weare from that.""Fei-Fei Li **FL:** So there's two layers to your comment. One is how do you trust and beable to comprehend AIâ€™s explanation? Second is actually can AI be used to makehumans more trustful or be more trustworthy as humans. The first point, Iagree with you, if AI ",,,,ives you 2,000 dimensions of potential features with,,,,probability, it's not understandable, but the entire history of science in,,,human civilization is to be able to communicate the results of science in,,,,,better and better ways. Right? Like I just had my annual physical and a whole,,,,,bunch of numbers came to my cell phone. And, well, first of all my doctors,,,the experts, can help me to explain these numbers. Now even Wikipedia can help,,,,me to explain some of these numbers, but the technological improvements of,,,,explaining these will improve. It's our failure as a technologists if we just,,,,,throw 200 or 2,000 dimensions of probability numbers at you.,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** But this is the explanation. And I think that the point you raised,,,,,is very important. But I see it differently. I think science is getting worse,,,,,and worse in explaining its theories and findings to the general public, which,,,,is the reason for things like doubting climate change, and so forth. And it's,,,,not really even the fault of the scientists, because the science is just,,,,getting more and more complicated. And reality is extremely complicated. And,,,,,the human mind wasn't adapted to understanding the dynamics of climate change,,,,,or the real reasons for refusing to give somebody a loan. But that's the point,,,,,when you have an â€” and let's put aside the whole question of manipulation and,,,,,how can I trust. Let's assume the AI is benign. And let's assume there are no,,,,,hidden biases and everything is ok. But still, I can't understand.,,,,,,,,, **FL:** But that's why people like Nick, the storyteller, has to explainâ€_,,,What I'm saying, You're right. It's very complex.,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Iâ€™m going to lose my job to a computer like next week, but I'm happy,,,,to have your confidence with me!,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** But that's the job of the society collectively to explain the complex,,,,,science. I'm not saying we're doing a great job at all. But I'm saying there,,,,,is hope if we try.,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** But my fear is that we just really can't do it. Because the human,,,,,mind is not built for dealing with these kinds of explanations and,,,,,technologies. And it's true for, I mean, it's true for the individual customer,,,who goes to the bank and the bank refused to give them a loan. And it can even,,,,,be on the level, I mean, how many people today on earth understand the,,,financial system? How many presidents and prime ministers understand the,,,,,financial system?,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** In this country, it's zero.,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** So what does it mean to live in a society where the people who are,,,,,supposed to be running the businessâ€_ And again, it's not the fault of a,,,,particular politician, it's just the financial system has become so,,,,complicated. And I don't think that economists are trying on purpose to hide,,,,,something from the general public. It's just extremely complicated. You have,,,,,some of the wisest people in the world, going to the finance industry, and,,,creating these enormously complex models and tools, which objectively you just,,,,can't explain to most people, unless first of all, they study economics and,,,mathematics for 10 years or whatever. So I think this is a real crisis. And,,,,,this is again, this is part of the philosophical crisis we started with. And,,,,the undermining of human agency. That's part of what's happening, that we have,,,,these extremely intelligent tools that are able to make perhaps better,,,,,decisions about our healthcare, about our financial system, but we can't,,,understand what they are doing and why they're doing it. And this undermines,,,,,our autonomy and our authority. And we don't know as a society how to deal,,,,,with that.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Ideally, Fei-Feiâ€™s institute will help that. But before we leave this,,,,topic, I want to move to a very closely related question, which I think is one,,,of the most interesting, which is the question of bias in algorithms, which is,,,something you've spoken eloquently about. And let's start with the financial,,,,,system. So you can imagine an algorithm used by a bank to determine whether,,,,,somebody should get a loan. And you can imagine training it on historical data,,,,,and historical data is racist. And we don't want that. So let's figure out how,,,,,to make sure the data isn't racist, and that it gives loans to people,,,,regardless of race. And we probably all, everybody in this room agrees that,,,,that is a good outcome.,,,,,,,,,,But let's say that analyzing the historical data suggests that women are more,,,,,likely to repay their loans than men. Do we strip that out? Or do we allow,,,,,that to stay in? If you allow it to stay in, you get a slightly more efficient,,,,financial system? If you strip it out, you have a little more equality before,,,,between men and women. How do you make decisions about what biases you want to,,,,,strip and which ones are okay to keep?,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** Yeah, that's an excellent question, Nick. I mean, I'm not going to,,have the answers personally, but I think you touch on the really important,,,,question, which is, first of all, machine learning system bias is a real,,thing. You know, like you said, it starts with data, it probably starts with,,the very moment we're collecting data and the type of data weâ€™re collecting,,,,,all the way through the whole pipeline, and then all the way to the,,,,application. But biases come in very complex ways. At Stanford, we have,,,,machine learning scientists studying the technical solutions of bias, like,,,,you know, de-biasing data or normalizing certain decision making. But we also,,,,have humanists debating about what is bias, what is fairness, when is bias,,,good, when is bias bad? So I think you just opened up a perfect topic for,,,,research and debate and conversation in this in this topic. And I also want to,,,,,point out that you've already used a very closely related example, a machine,,,,learning algorithm has a potential to actually expose bias. Right? You know,,,,,one of my favorite studies was a paper a couple of years ago analyzing,,,,,Hollywood movies and using a machine learning face-recognition algorithm,,,,,which is a very [controversial technology these,,,,,days](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-facial-recognition-congress-bias-law-,,,,,enforcement/), to recognize Hollywood systematically gives more screen time to,,,,male actors than female actors. No human being can sit there and count all the,,,,,frames of faces and whether there is gender bias and this is a perfect example,,,,,of using machine learning to expose. So in general there's a rich set of,,,,,issues we should study and again, bring the humanists, bring the ethicist,,,bring the legal scholars, bring the gender study experts.,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Agreed. Though, standing up for humans, I knew Hollywood was sexist,,,even before that paper. but yes, agreed.,,,,,,,,, **FL:** You're a smart human.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Yuval, on that question of the loans, do you strip out the racist,,,data, you strip out the gender data? What biases you get rid of what biases do,,,,you not?,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** I don't think there is a one size fits all. I mean, it's a question,,,,we, again, we need this day-to-day collaboration between engineers and,,,ethicists and psychologists and political scientists,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** But not biologists, right?,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** And increasingly, also biologists! And, you know, it goes back to,,the question, what should we do? So, we should teach ethics to coders as part,,,of the curriculum, that the people today in the world that most need a,,,,background in ethics, are the people in the computer science departments. So,,,,it should be an integral part of the curriculum. And also in the big,,,,,corporations, which are designing these tools, should be embedded within the,,,teams, people with backgrounds in things like ethics, like politics, that they,,always think in terms of what biases might we inadvertently be building into,,,,,our system? What could be the cultural or political implications of what we're,,,,,building? It shouldn't be a kind of afterthought that you create this neat,,,,,technical gadget, it goes into the world, something bad happens, and then you,,start thinking, â€œOh, we didn't see this one coming. What do we do now?â€ù From,,,the very beginning, it should be clear that this is part of the process.,,,,,,,,, **FL:** I do want to give a shout out to Rob Reich, who introduced this whole,,,,event. He and my colleagues, Mehran Sahami and a few other Stanford professors,,,,have opened this course called Computers, **Ethics** and Public Policy. This,,,,is exactly the kind of class thatâ€™s needed. I think this quarter the offering,,,,,has more than 300 students signed up for that.,,,,,,,,,,"> """"We should be focusing on technology that has a more nuanced understanding",,,,,"of human intelligence.""""",,,,,,,,,,Fei-Fei Li,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Fantastic. I wish that course has existed when I was a student here.,,,,,Let me ask an excellent question from the audience that ties into this. How do,,,,,you reconcile the inherent trade-offs between explainability and efficacy and,,,,,accuracy of algorithms?,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** Great question. This question seems to be assuming if you can explain,,,,,that you're less good or less accurate?,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Well, you can imagine that if you require explainability, you lose,,,some level of efficiency, you're adding a little bit of complexity to the,,,,algorithm. So, okay, first of all, I don't necessarily believe in that.,,There's no mathematical logic to this assumption. Second, let's assume there,,,,is a possibility that an explainable algorithm suffers in efficiency. I think,,,,,this is a societal decision we have to make. You know, when we put the,,,,seatbelt in our car driving, that's a little bit of an efficiency loss because,,,,I have to do the seat belt movement instead of just hopping in and driving.,,,,,But as a society, we decided we can afford that loss of efficiency because we,,,,care more about human safety. So I think AI is the same kind of technology. As,,,,,we make these kind of decisions going forward in our solutions, in our,,,,products, we have to balance human well-being and societal well-being with,,,,efficiency.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** So Yuval, let me ask you the global consequences of this. This is,,,,something that a number of people have asked about in different ways and we've,,,,,touched on but we haven't hit head on. There are two countries, imagine you,,,,have Country A and you have Country B. Country A says all of you AI engineers,,,,,you have to make it explainable. You have to take ethics classes, you have to,,,,really think about the consequences and what you're doing. You got to have,,,,,dinner with biologists, you have to think about love, and you have to like,,,read John Locke, that's Country A. Country B says, just go build some stuff,,,right? These two countries at some point are going to come in conflict, and,,,,I'm going to guess that Country Bâ€™s technology might be ahead of Country Aâ€™s.,,,,,Is that a concern?,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** Yeah, that's always the concern with arms races, which become a race,,,to the bottom in the name of efficiency and domination. I mean, what is,,,,extremely problematic or dangerous about the situation now with AI, is that,,,,more and more countries are waking up to the realization that this could be,,,,,the technology of domination in the 21st century. So you're not talking about,,,,,just any economic competition between the different textile industries or even,,,,,between different oil industries, like one country decides to we don't care,,,,about the environment at all, weâ€™ll just go full gas ahead and the other,,,,countries are much more environmentally aware. The situation with AI is,,,,,potentially much worse, because it could be really the technology of,,,,domination in the 21st century. And those left behind could be dominated,,,,,exploited, conquered by those who forge ahead. So nobody wants to stay behind.,,,,And I think the only way to prevent this kind of catastrophic arms race to the,,,,,bottom is greater global cooperation around AI. Now, this sounds utopian,,,,because we are now moving in exactly the opposite direction of more and more,,,,,rivalry and competition. But this is part of, I think, of our job, like with,,the nuclear arms race, to make people in different countries realize that this,,,,is an arms race, that whoever wins, humanity loses. And it's the same with AI.,,,If AI becomes an arms race, then this is extremely bad news for all humans.,,,,And it's easy for, say, people in the US to say we are the good guys in this,,,race, you should be cheering for us. But this is becoming more and more,,,,difficult in a situation when the motto of the day is America First. How can,,,,,we trust the USA to be the leader in AI technology, if ultimately it will,,,,serve only American interests and American economic and political domination?,,,,,So I think, most people when they think arms race in AI, they think USA versus,,,China, but there are almost 200 other countries in the world. And most of them,,,,are far, far behind. And when they look at what is happening, they are,,,increasingly terrified. And for a very good reason.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** The historical example you've made is a little unsettling. Because,,,,,if I heard your answer correctly, it's that we need global cooperation. And if,,,,we don't, we're going to need an arms race. In the actual nuclear arms race,,,,we tried for global cooperation from, I don't know, roughly 1945 to 1950. And,,,then we gave up and then we said, We're going full throttle in the United,,,,States. And then, Why did the Cold War end the way it did? Who knows but one,,,,argument would be that the United States and its relentless buildup of nuclear,,,,,weapons helped to keep the peace until the Soviet Union collapsed. So if that,,,,,is the parallel, then what might happen here is weâ€™ll try for global,,,,cooperation and 2019,2020, and 2021 and then weâ€™ll be off [in an arms,,,race.](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-cold-war-china-could-doom-us-all/) A, is,,,,that likely and B, if it is, would you say well, then the US needs to really,,move full throttle on AI because it will be better for the liberal democracies,,,,,to have artificial intelligence than totalitarian states?,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** Well, I'm afraid it is very likely that cooperation will break down,,,,and we will find ourselves in an extreme version of an arms race. And in a way,,,,,it's worse than the nuclear arms race because with nukes, at least until,,,,today, countries developed them, but never use them. AI will be used all the,,,time. It's not something you have on the shelf for some Doomsday war. It will,,,,,be used all the time to create potentially total surveillance regimes and,,,,,extreme totalitarian systems, in one way or the other. And so, from this,,,perspective, I think the danger is far greater. You could say that the nuclear,,,,arms race actually saved democracy and the free market and, you know, rock and,,,roll and Woodstock and then the hippies and they all owe a huge debt to,,,,,nuclear weapons. Because if nuclear weapons weren't invented, there would have,,,,been a conventional arms race and conventional military buildup between the,,,,,Soviet bloc and the American bloc. And that would have meant total,,,,,mobilization of society. If the Soviets are having total mobilization, the,,,,only way the Americans can compete is to do the same.,,,,,,,,,,Now what actually happened was that you had an extreme totalitarian mobilized,,,,,society in the communist bloc. But thanks to nuclear weapons, you didn't have,,,,to do it in the United States or in Western Germany, or in France, because we,,,relied on nukes. You don't need millions of conscripts in the army.,,,,,,,,,,And with AI it is going to be just the opposite, that the technology will not,,,,only be developed, it will be used all the time. And that's a very scary,,,,scenario.,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** Wait, can I just add one thing? I don't know history like you do, but,,,you said AI is different from nuclear technology. I do want to point out, it,,,,is very different because at the same time as you're talking about these,,,,,scarier situations, this technology has a wide international scientific,,,,collaboration that is being used to make transportation better, to improve,,,,healthcare, to improve education. And so it's a very interesting new time that,,,,we haven't seen before because while we have this kind of competition, we also,,,,have massive international scientific community collaboration on these,,,,,benevolent uses and democratization of this technology. I just think it's,,,,,important to see both sides of this.,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** You're absolutely right here. There are some, as I said, there's,,,also enormous benefits to this technology.,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** And in a in a globally collaborative way, especially between and,,,,among scientists.,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** The global aspect is is more complicated, because the question is,,,,what happens if there is a huge gap in abilities between some countries and,,,,,most of the world? Would we have a rerun of the 19th century Industrial,,,,,Revolution when the few industrial powers conquer and dominate and exploit the,,,,,entire world, both economically and politically? Whatâ€™s to prevent that from,,,,repeating? So even in terms of, you know, without this scary war scenario, we,,might still find ourselves with global exploitation regime, in which the,,,,benefits, most of the benefits, go to a small number of countries at the,,,expense of everybody else.,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** So students in the audience will laugh at this but we are in a very,,,,,different scientific research climate. The kind of globalization of technology,,,,,and technique happens in a way that the 19th century, even the 20th century,,,,never saw before. Any paper that is a basic science research paper in AI today,,,,,or technical technique that is produced, let's say this week at Stanford, it's,,,easily globally distributed through this thing called arXiv or GitHub,,,,,repository orâ€”,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** The information is out there. Yeah.,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** The globalization of this scientific technology travels in a,,,,,different way from the 19th and 20th century. I don't doubt there is confined,,,,,development of this technology, maybe by regimes. But we do have to recognize,,,,that this global reach, the differences are pretty sharp now. And we might,,,,need to take that into consideration. That the scenario you're describing is,,,,,harder, Iâ€™m not saying impossible, but harder to happen.,,,,,,,, **YNH:** I'll just say that it's not just the scientific papers. Yes, the,,,,scientific papers are there. But if I live in Yemen, or in Nicaragua, or in,,,Indonesia or in Gaza, yes, I can connect to the internet and download the,,,paper. What will I do with that? I don't have the data, I don't have the,,,,infrastructure. I mean, you look at where the big corporations are coming,,,,from, that hold all the data of the world, they're basically coming from just,,,two places. I mean, even Europe is not really in the competition. There is no,,,,European Google, or European Amazon, or European Baidu, of European Tencent.,,And if you look beyond Europe, you think about Central America, you think,,,about most of Africa, the Middle East, much of Southeast Asia, itâ€™s, yes, thebasic scientific knowledge is out there, but this is just one of the,,,,components that go to creating something that can compete with Amazon or with,,,,,Tencent, or with the abilities of governments like the US government or like,,,,the Chinese government. So I agree that the dissemination of information and,,,,,basic scientific knowledge are in a completely different place than the 19th,,,,,century.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Let me ask you about that, because it's something three or four,,,,people have asked in the questions, which is, it seems like there could be a,,,centralizing force of artificial intelligence that will make whoever has the,,,,,data and the best computer more powerful and it could then accentuate income,,,,,inequality, both within countries and within the world, right? You can imagine,,,the countries you've just mentioned, the United States, China, Europe lagging,,behind, Canada somewhere behind, way ahead of Central America, it could,,accentuate global income inequality. A, do you think that's likely and B, how,,,much does it worry you?,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** As I said, it's very likely it's already happening. And it's,,,,extremely dangerous. Because the economic and political consequences could be,,,,,catastrophic. We are talking about the potential collapse of entire economies,,,,,and countries, countries that depend on cheap manual labor, and they just,,,don't have the educational capital to compete in a world of AI. So what are,,,,,these countries going to do? I mean, if, say, you shift back most production,,from, say, Honduras or Bangladesh to the USA and to Germany, because the human,,salaries are no longer part of the equation and it's cheaper to produce the,,,,,shirt in California than in Honduras, so what will the people there do? And,,,,you can say, okay, but there will be many more jobs for software engineers.,,,But we are not teaching the kids in Honduras to be software engineers. So,,,,,maybe a few of them could somehow immigrate to the US. But most of them wonâ€™t,,,,,and what will they do? And we, at present, we don't have the economic answers,,,and the political answers to these questions.,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** I think that's fair enough, I think Yuval definitely has laid out,,,,some of the critical pitfalls of this and, and that's why we need more people,,,,to be studying and thinking about this. One of the things we over and over,,,,,noticed, even in this process of building the community of human-centered AI,,,,and also talking to people both internally and externally, is that there are,,,,opportunities for businesses around the world and governments around the world,,,,,to think about their data and AI strategy. There are still many opportunities,,,,,outside of the big players, in terms of companies and countries, to really,,,come to the realization that it's an important moment for their country, for,,,,their region, for their business, to transform into this digital age. And I,,,think when you talk about these potential dangers and lack of data in parts of,,,,,the world that haven't really caught up with this digital transformation, the,,,,moment is now and we hope to, you know, raise that kind of awareness and,,,encourage that kind of transformation.,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** Yeah, I think it's very urgent. I mean, what we are seeing at the,,,moment is, on the one hand, what you could call some kind of data,,,colonization, that the same model that we saw in the 19th century that you,,,,have the imperial hub, where they have the advanced technology, they grow the,,,cotton in India or Egypt, they send the raw materials to Britain, they produce,,,the shirts, the high tech industry of the 19th century in Manchester, and they,,,send the shirts back to sell them in in India and outcompete the local,,,,,producers. And we, in a way, might be beginning to see the same thing now with,,,the data economy, that they harvest the data in places also like Brazil and,,,,Indonesia, but they don't process the data there. The data from Brazil and,,,,Indonesia, goes to California or goes to eastern China being processed there.,,,,They produce the wonderful new gadgets and technologies and sell them back as,,,,,finished products to the provinces or to the colonies.,,,,,,,,,,Now it's not a one-to-one. It's not the same, there are differences. But I,,,,think we need to keep this analogy in mind. And another thing that maybe we,,,,,need to keep in mind in this respect, I think, is the reemergence of stone,,,wallsâ€”originally my speciality was medieval military history. This is how I,,,,,began my academic career with the Crusades and castles and knights and so,,,,,forth. And now I'm doing all these cyborgs and AI stuff. But suddenly, there,,,,is something that I know from back then, the walls are coming back. I try to,,,,kind of look at what's happening here. I mean, we have virtual realities. We,,,,have 3G, AI and suddenly the hottest political issue is building a stone wall.,,,,Like the most low-tech thing you can imagine. And what is the significance of,,,,,a stone wall in a world of interconnectivity and and all that? And it really,,,,,frightens me that there is something very sinister there. The combination of,,,,,data is flowing around everywhere so easily, but more and more countries and,,,,also my home country of Israel, it's the same thing. You have the, you know,,,the startup nation, and then the wall. And what does it mean this combination?,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Fei-Fei, you want to answer that?,,,,,,,,, **FL:** Maybe we can look at the next question!,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** You know what? Let's go to the next question, which is tied to that.,,,,And the next question is: you have the people here at Stanford who will help,,,,,build these companies, who will either be furthering the process of data,,,,colonization, or reversing it or who will be building, you know, the efforts,,to create a virtual wall and world based on artificial intelligence are being,,,,,created, or funded at least by a Stanford graduate. So you have all these,,,,students here in the room, how do you want them to be thinking about,,,,artificial intelligence? And what do you want them to learn? Let's, let's,,,,spend the last 10 minutes of this conversation talking about what everybody,,,,,here should be doing.,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** So if you're a computer science or engineering student, take Rob's,,,,class. If you're humanists take my class. And all of you read Yuvalâ€™s books.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Are his books on your syllabus?,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** Not on mine. Sorry! I teach hardcore deep learning. His book doesn't,,,,,have equations. But seriously, what I meant to say is that Stanford students,,,,you have a great opportunity. We have a proud history of bringing this,,,,,technology to life. Stanford was at the forefront of the birth of AI. In fact,,,,,our Professor John McCarthy coined the term artificial intelligence and came,,,,,to Stanford in 1963 and started this nation's, one of the two oldest, AI labs,,,in this country. And since then, Stanford's AI research has been at the,,,,forefront of every wave of AI changes. And in 2019 we're also at the forefront,,,,,of starting the human-centered AI revolution or the writing of the new AI,,,,,chapter. And we did all this for the past 60 years for you guys, for the,,,,people who come through the door and who will graduate and become,,,,,practitioners, leaders, and part of the civil society and that's really what,,,the bottom line is about. Human-centered AI needs to be written by the next,,,,,generation of technologists who have taken classes like Rob's class, to think,,,,about the ethical implications, the human well being. And it's also going to,,,,be written by those potential future policymakers who came out of Stanfordâ€™s,,,,,humanities studies and Business School, who are versed in the details of the,,,,technology, who understand the implications of this technology, and who have,,,the capability to communicate with the technologists. That is, no matter how,,,,we agree and disagree, that's the bottom line, is that we need this kind of,,,multilingual leaders and thinkers and practitioners. And that is what,,,,,Stanford's Human-centered AI Institute is about.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Yuval, how do you answer that question?,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** On the individual level, I think it's important for every individual,,,,whether in Stanford, whether an engineer or not, to get to know yourself,,,better, because you're now in a competition. It's the oldest advice in all the,,,,books in philosophies is know yourself. We've heard it from Socrates, from,,,,Confucius, from Buddha: get to know yourself. But there is a difference, which,,,is that now you have competition. In the day of Socrates or Buddha, if you,,,,didn't make the effort, okay, so you missed on enlightenment. But still, the,,king wasn't competing with you. They didn't have the technology. Now you have,,,,,competition. You're competing against these giant corporations and,,,,,governments. If they get to know you better than you know yourself, the game,,,,is over. So you need to buy yourself some time and the first way to buy,,,,,yourself some time is to get to know yourself better, and then they have more,,,,ground to cover. For engineers and students, I would sayâ€”I'll focus on it on,,,,engineers maybeâ€”the two things that I would like to see coming out from the,,,,,laboratories and and the engineering departments, is first, tools that,,,inherently work better in a decentralized system than in a centralized system.,,,,,I don't know how to do it. But I hope this is something that engineers can can,,,,,work with. I heard that [blockchain](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-,,,,,blockchain/) is like the big promise in in that area, I don't know. But,,,,whatever it is, part of when you start designing the tool, part of the,,,specification of what this tool should be like, I would say, this tool should,,,work better in a decentralized system than in a centralized system. That's the,,,,,best defense of democracy.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** I don't want to cut you off, because I want you to get to the second,,,,thing. But how do you make a tool work better in a democracy?,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** I'm not an engineer, I don't know.,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Okay. Go to part two. Someone in this room, figure that out, because,,,it's very important.,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** And I can give you historical examples of tools that work better in,,,,,this way or in that way. But I don't know how to translate it into present day,,,,,technology.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Go to part two because I got a few more questions from the audience.,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** Okay, so the other thing I would like to see coming is an AI,,,,sidekick that serves me and not some corporation or government. I mean, we,,,,can't stop the progress of this kind of technology, but I would like to see it,,,,serving me. So yes, it can hack me but it hacks me in order to protect me.,,,,Like my computer has an antivirus but by brain hasn't. It has a biological,,,,,antivirus against the flu or whatever, but not against hackers and trolls and,,,,so forth. So, one project to work on is to create an AI sidekick, which I paid,,,for, maybe a lot of money and it belongs to me, and it follows me and it,,,monitors me and what I do in my interactions, but everything it learns, it,,,learns in order to protect me from manipulation by other AIs, by other outside,,,,influencers. So this is something that I think with the present day,,,,,technology, I would like to see more effort in in the direction.,,,,,,,,, **FL:** Not to get into technical terms, but I think you I think you would,,,,feel confident to know that the budding efforts in this kind of research is,,,,,happening you know, trustworthy AI, explainable AI, security-motivated or,,aware AI. So I'm not saying we have the solution, but a lot of technologists,,,,around the world are thinking along that line and trying to make that happen.,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** It's not that I want an AI that belongs to Google or to the,,,,,government that I can trust. I want an AI that I'm its master. It's serving,,,,,me.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** And it's powerful, it's more powerful than my AI because otherwise my,,,,AI could manipulate your AI.,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** It will have the inherent advantage of knowing me very well. So it,,,,,might not be able to hack you. But because it follows me around and it has,,,,,access to everything I do and so forth, it gives it an edge in this specific,,,,realm of just me. So this is a kind of counterbalance to the danger that the,,,,,peopleâ€”,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** But even that would have a lot of challenges in their society. Who is,,,,,accountable, are you accountable for your actions or your sidekick?,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** This is going to be a more and more difficult question that we will,,,,,have to deal with.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Alright Fei-Fei, let's go through a couple questions quickly. We,,,,often talk about top-down AI from the big companies, how should we design,,,,personal AI to help accelerate our lives and careers? The way I interpret that,,,,,question is, so much of AI is being done at the big companies. If you want to,,,,have AI at a small company or personally, can you do that?,,,,,,,,, **FL:** So well, first of all, one of the solutions is what Yuval just said.,,,,,,,, **NT:** Probably those things were built by Facebook.,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** So first of all, it's true, there is a lot of investment and effort,,,and resource putting big companies in AI research and development, but it's,,,,not that all the AI is happening there. I want to say that academia continues,,,,,to play a huge role in AIâ€™s research and development, especially in the long,,,,term exploration of AI. And what is academia? Academia is a worldwide network,,,,,of individual students and professors thinking very independently and,,,,,creatively about different ideas. So from that point of view, it's a very,,,,grassroots kind of effort in AI research that continues to happen. And small,,,,,businesses and independent research Institutes also have a role to play. There,,,,,are a lot of publicly available data sets. Itâ€™s a global community that is,,,,,very open about sharing and disseminating knowledge and technology. So yes,,,,,please, by all means, we want global participation in this.,,,,,,,, **NT:** All right, here's my favorite question. This is from anonymous,,,,unfortunately. If I am in eighth grade, do I still need to study?,,,,,,,,, **FL:** As a mom, I will tell you yes. Go back to your homework.,,,,,,,,, **NT:**. Alright Fei-Fei, What do you want Yuvalâ€™s next book to be about?,,,,,,,,, **FL:** Wow, I need to think about that.,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Alright. Well, while you think about that, Yuval, what area of,,machine learning you want Fei-Fei to pursue next?,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** The sidekick project.,,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** Yeah, I mean, just what I said. Can we create the kind of AI which,,,can serve individual people, and not some kind of big network? I mean, is that,,,even possible? Or is there something about the nature of AI, which inevitably,,,,will always lead back to some kind of network effect, and winner takes all and,,,,so forth.,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** Ok, his next book is going to be a science fiction book between you,,,,and your sidekick.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Alright, one last question for Yuval, because we've got the top voted,,,question. Without the belief in free will, what gets you up in the morning?,,,,,,,,, **YNH:** Without the belief in free will? I don't think that's the question â€_,,,,,I mean, itâ€™s very interesting, very central, it has been central in Western,,civilization because of some kind of basically theological mistake made,,,,,thousands of years ago. But really it's a misunderstanding of the human,,,,,condition.,,,,,,,,,,The real question is, how do you liberate yourself from suffering? And one of,,,,the most important steps in that direction is to get to know yourself better.,,,,,For me, the biggest problem was the belief in free will, is that it makes,,,people incurious about themselves and about what is really happening inside,,,,,themselves because they basically say, â€œI know everything. I know why I make,,,,decisions, this is my free will.â€ù And they identify with whatever thought or,,,,emotion pops up in their mind because this is my free will. And this makes,,,,,them very incurious about what is really happening inside and what is also the,,,,,deep sources of the misery in their lives. And so this is what makes me wake,,,,,up in the morning, to try and understand myself better to try and understand,,,,the human condition better. And free will is just irrelevant for that.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** And if we lose your sidekick and get you up in the morning. Fei-Fei,,,,,75 minutes ago, you said we weren't gonna reach any conclusions Do you think,,,,we got somewhere?,,,,,,,,,, **FL:** Well, we opened the dialog between the humanist and the technologist,,,,and I want to see more of that.,,,,,,,,,, **NT:** Great.

But AI also has thepotential to replicate or exacerbate long-standing biases. As machine learninghas matured beyond simpler task-based algorithms, it has come to rely moreheavily on deep-learning architectures that pick up on relationships that nohuman could see or predict. These algorithms can be extraordinarily powerful,but they are also â€œblack boxesâ€ù where the inputs and the outputs may bevisible, but how exactly the two are related is not transparent.Given their very complexity, bias can creep into the algorithmsâ€™ outputswithout their designers intending it to, or without them even knowing the biasis there. So perhaps it is unsurprising that many people are wary of the powervested in machine-learning algorithms.[Inhi Cho Suh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inhicho/), General Manager, IBMWatson Customer Engagement, and [FlorianZettelmeyer](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/zettelmeyer_florian.aspx),a professor of marketing at Kellogg and chair of the schoolâ€™s marketingdepartment, are both invested in understanding how deep-learning algorithmscan identify, account for, and reduce bias.The pair discuss the social and ethical challenges machine learning poses, aswell as the more general question of how developers and companies can go aboutbuilding AI that is transparent, fair, and socially responsible. __ _This interview has been edited for length and clarity._ **Florian ZETTELMEYER:** So, let me kick it off with one example of bias inalgorithms, which is the quality of face recognition. The subjects used totrain the algorithm are vastly more likely to be nonminority than members ofminorities. So as a result of that, the quality of facial recognition turnsout to be better if you happen to look more conventionally Western than if youhave some other ethnicity. **Inhi Cho SUH:** Yes, thatâ€™s one example of a bias because of lack of data.Another really good example of this bias is in loan approval. If you look atthe financial services sector, there are fewer women-owned businesses. Sotherefore you may have loans being arbitrarily denied rather than approvedbecause the lack of sufficient data adds too much uncertainty. **ZETTELMEYER:** You donâ€™t want to approve a loan unless you have some levelof certainty [in the accuracy of your algorithm], but a lack of data doesnâ€™tallow you to make your statistical inputs good enough.What do you think of the [Microsoftbot](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/technology/microsoft-created-a-twitter-bot-to-learn-from-users-it-quickly-became-a-racist-jerk.html) exampleon Twitter [where the bot quickly mirrored other usersâ€™ sexist and racistlanguage]? Thatâ€™s another source of bias: it seems to be a case where analgorithm gets led astray because the people it is learning from are not verynice. ******SUH:** There are some societal and cultural norms that are more acceptablethan others. For each of us as a person, we know and we learn the differencebetween what is and isnâ€™t acceptable through experience. For an AI system,thatâ€™s going to require a tremendous amount of thoughtful training. Otherwise,it wonâ€™t pick up on the sarcasm. Itâ€™ll pick up on the wrong context in thewrong situation. **ZETTELMEYER:** Thatâ€™s right. In some sense, we face this with our children:they live in a world that is full of profanity, but we would like them to notuse that language. Itâ€™s very difficult. They need a set of valueinstructionsâ€”they canâ€™t just be picking up everything from whatâ€™s around them. **SUH:** Absolutely. And Western culture is very different than Easternculture, or Middle Eastern culture. So culture must be considered, and thevalue code [that the algorithm is trained with] has to be intentionallydesigned. And you do that by bringing in policymakers, academics, designers,and researchers who understand the userâ€™s values in various contexts. **ZETTELMEYER:** I think thereâ€™s actually a larger point here that goes evenbeyond the notion of bias.Iâ€™m trained as an economist, and very often economics has not done aparticularly good job at incorporating the notion of â€œvaluesâ€ù into economicanalysis. Thereâ€™s this very strong sense of wanting to strive for efficiency,and as long as things are efficient, you can avoid considering whether theoutcomes are beneficial to society.What I find interesting is that in this entire space of AI and analytics, thediscussion around values is supercharged. I think it has to do with the factthat analytics and AI are very powerful weapons that can be used in verystrategic, very targeted ways. And as a result of this, it seems absolutelycrucial for an organization that chooses to implement these techniques to havea code of conduct or a set of values that governs these techniques. Right? Imean, just because you can do something, doesnâ€™t mean that you actually oughtto do it.Where you have these very powerful tools available that can really movethings, you have an obligation to understand the larger impact. **SUH:** Accountability is one of the five areas that we are focusing on forcreating trust in AI.Many businesses are applying AI to not just create better experiences forconsumers, but to monetize for profit. They may be doing it in ways where,say, data rights may not be balanced appropriately with the return on economicvalue, or efficiency. So itâ€™s an important discussion: Whoâ€™s accountable whenthere are risks in addition to benefits? ******ZETTELMEYER:** Do you think this is new? **SUH:** I do a little bit, because in previous scenarios, business programsand applications were programmable. You had to put in the logic and rules[explicitly]. When you get into machine learning, youâ€™re not going to havedirect human intervention at every step. So then, what are the designprinciples that you intended? **ZETTELMEYER:** So a fair way of saying this is, in essence, weâ€™ve alwayshad this issue of ownership, except with machine learning, you can potentiallyget away with thinking you donâ€™t need it.But youâ€™re saying that thatâ€™s a fallacy, because you do need accountability atthe end of the day when something blows up. **SUH:** Exactly. And this goes back to [training an algorithm to have] afundamental understanding of right and wrong in a wide range of contexts. Youcanâ€™t just put the chat bot into the public sphere and say, â€œHere, just golearn,â€ù without understanding the implications of how that system actuallylearns, and the subsequent consequences. **ZETTELMEYER:** Okay, accountability. Whatâ€™s your second focus area to buildtrust in AI? **SUH:** Itâ€™s a focus on values. What are the norms for a common set of coreprinciples that you operate under? And depending on different cultural norms,whom do you bring into the process [of creating these principles]?Thereâ€™s a third focus area around data rights and data privacy, mostly interms of consumer protectionâ€”because there are companies that offer anexchange of data for a free service of some sort, and the consumer might notrealize that theyâ€™re actually giving permission, not just for that oneinstance, but for perpetuity. **ZETTELMEYER:** Do you think it is realistic today to think of consumersstill having some degree of ownership over their data? ******SUH:** I do think thereâ€™s a way to solve for this. I donâ€™t think weâ€™vesolved it yet, but I do think thereâ€™s a possibility of enabling individuals tounderstand what information is being used by whom and when.Part of that is a burden on the institutions around explainability. Thatâ€™snumber fourâ€”being able to explain your algorithm: explain the data sets thatwere used, explain the approach holistically, be able to detect where youmight have biases. This is why explainability and fairnessâ€”thatâ€™s numberfiveâ€”go hand in hand. **ZETTELMEYER:** In an academic context, I refer to this as transparency ofexecution.I actually thought you were going to say something slightly different, that weneed to move to a place where some of the more flexible algorithms like neuralnetworks or deep learning can be interpreted.Itâ€™s a hard problem because, in some sense, precisely what makes thesealgorithms work so well is what makes them so hard to explain. In other words,the problem with these algorithms isnâ€™t that you canâ€™t write them down. Youcan always write them down. The problem is that itâ€™s very difficult to createsome easily understandable association between inputs and outputs, becauseeverything depends on everything else.But I think the point you were making is: okay, even if we do have a so-calledâ€œblack boxâ€ù algorithm, a lot of the biases arise, not necessarily from thealgorithm per se, but from the fact that weâ€™re applying this algorithm to aparticular setting and data set, yet itâ€™s just not clear to people how itâ€™sbeing implemented. **SUH:** Thatâ€™s right.When and for what purpose are we actually applying AI? What are the majorsources of that data? And how are we working to, if not eliminate bias, maybemitigate it? **ZETTELMEYER:** I think a lot of the trust problems that have occurred inthe tech industryâ€”and particularly in advertisingâ€”over the last years, aredirectly related to a lack of transparency of that type. Iâ€™m always amazedthat when you go to the big advertising platforms, and you approached thempurely as a consumer, and then you approach them as a client, it feels likeyouâ€™re dealing with two different universes. As consumer, Iâ€™m not sure youhave the same sense of exactly whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes as you do ifyou happen to be an advertiser, and you have exposure to all the digital toolsthat you can use for targeting.I think transparency, the way youâ€™re talking about it, is not particularlywell implemented in many tech companies. **SUH:** No. And thereâ€™s not a common language for talking about it either,in terms of explicitly saying, â€œWe only use data that we have access andrights to, and this is how we collect it, and youâ€™ve given us permission forit.â€ù The standards around the language itself are still being developed. **ZETTELMEYER:** What are you doing about all this at IBM? **SUH:** We actually developed a [360 degrees fairnesskit](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/09/ai-fairness-360/) as part ofour broader [AI OpenScale](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-openscale)initiative. AI OpenScale is an open technology platform that enables yourbusiness with visibility, control, and the ability to improve AI deployments,helps explain AI outcomes, and scales AI usage with automated neural networkdesign and deployment, all within a unified management console. It includesopen-source toolkits to check for unwanted biases in data sets and machine-learning modules. It checks for biases like explainability around your datasets to provide feedback on different aspects of your models.Itâ€™s the first open-platform and open-source toolkit to even begin to getdevelopers thinking about bias proactively. _This is the first in a series of conversations between Kellogg Schoolfaculty and IBM Watson leaders._",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","# 5 Best Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Books in 2019We have reviewed the top 5 best Artificial Intelligence books available on theInternet.

AI isalready being used to hack us in multiple ways, from us gifting our data andprivate info to technology firms to how our attention on our mobile devices isfunneled.The internet has created new pillars that monetizes the future where AI isnâ€™tjust not regulated, it hasnâ€™t even hit its stride in how ubiquitous it willbecome.  * Attention economy  * Surveillance capitalism  * AI in driving global GDP  * AI in cybersecurity  * AIâ€™s role in technological loneliness (â€œdivide and conquer in the smart homeâ€ù)If AI has become the new â€œarms raceâ€ù between the likes of the U.S and China,we stand at the dawn of a new era where [AI will bothenhance](https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-kai-fu-lee-fei-fei-li-artificial-intelligence/) and hack us in ways we cannot yet imagine.After reading [Jun Wu](https://medium.com/@junwu_46652)â€™s piece on [Empathy inArtificial Intelligence](https://towardsdatascience.com/empathy-in-artificial-intelligence-eb167f62af99), it got me thinking. Male bias and themilitarization of AI is very dangerous for humanity. Itâ€™s probably anexistential threat to our survival as a species. I donâ€™t just mean this in theElon Musk terms of AGI, but in how we fail to regulate it.#### China will Lead Ethics in AI in the 21st CenturyAs China rises to dominance both technologically and economically that willbecome more pronounced in the 2030s, their approach to ethics in AI will beginto dominate the world. We can already tell that they will be the leaders inhow facial recognition informs universal systems of surveillance, themanifestation of social credit systems and the monetization of data in Asia.  * Facial recognition and its ethical implications.  * AI in the rise of Universal Surveillance Architecture Systems (USAS)  * Emergence of Social Credit Systems  * Monetization of data in Asia[China is bestpositioned](https://www.ft.com/content/f92abc38-6bb8-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d)in the future to influence and impact policy regarding the regulation of AI.They have started to think seriously about the [ethics ofAI.](https://www.scmp.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) Their thinking isnot yet mature, but if China can be a leader globally in any signal way thatis most important to the future of humanity, itâ€™s on the [regulation & ethicsof AI](https://www.scmp.com/business/commodities/article/2157700/ethics-and-pursuit-artificial-intelligence).Before that happens they will likely make a lot of mistakes and seriousbreaches of AI ethics, and its impact on things like human rights.#### The Age of Biotechnology & AI is an Ethical MinefieldWired recently interviewed Fei-Fei Li, you can read the interview[here](https://www.wired.com/story/will-artificial-intelligence-enhance-hack-humanity/). Here are some bullet points from that event:  * The era of Biotechnology will allow people to hack their humanity in ways that were never possible before.  * AI will be deeply implicated in how we hack other humans and alter even our DNA.  * The era of AI and biotech enhancements is coming, so the question is, who decides what is a good enhancement and what is a bad enhancement?  * YNH: _The easiest people to manipulate are the people who believe in free will, because they think they cannot be manipulated._An awesome debate. Yuval Noah Harari & Fei-Fei Li### The 4th Industrial Revolution  * In the 4th industrial revolution is an era of great convenience and major ethical questions that could lead to irreparable damage in how we evolve as a species (it could lead to our extinction).  * What are the good qualities we need to enhance? What happens when our military is automated and robotic? Is enhancing ourselves with AI dangerous?  * The technological pressure of innovation for monetization also means powerful corporations could easily become too powerful where they place corporate profits ahead of ethical considerations. In 2019, we already have a long list of such occurrences.  * There is already a crisis between engineers and their managers playing itself out at companies such as Google (and many other $1 Trillion dollar firms). The employees of BigTech are speaking out, with mixed results regarding the ethics of the work they are doing. AI is nearly always implicated in this.#### Enhancing Means Hacking HumanityAs companies like Amazon and Google invade the smart home, our private dataand health data will become a major issue in the ethics of AI. This is becausesimultaneously these companies will become giants in the AI of the future ofhealthcare.  * Google itself launched and[ dissolved its own AI ethics board](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18296113/google-ai-ethics-board-ends-controversy-kay-coles-james-heritage-foundation) due to major controversy surrounding it.  * In 2019, the debate about ethics in AI also centers on if putting _Advertising_ at the center of the internet is healthy for the world. Facebook & Google among others are implicated in this on-going debate.Apple and Facebook are pivoting into privacy architectures and walled gardensbased on subscription revenue (Apple) and the monetization of encrypted Chat(Facebook).The advent of artificial intelligence forces humanity, both governments andthe corporate sector to organize rules and guidelines on artificialintelligence, bio-technologies and robots that protects the fate of thespecies. Realistically this will take decades to find a global consensus on.### The 2020s are a â€œBlack Mirrorâ€ù decade for Ethics in AIBefore that takes place thereâ€™s a period where hacking (rather than enhancing)human becomes the wild-wild west of cybersecurity invasion. You can think ofsmartphone addiction and mobile app engineering as part of this stage.Fines against companies like Google & Facebook for monopolistic and privacydata infractions are slow and relatively minor compared to the scale,influence and power of these firms and the utilities they provide.#### Artificial General IntelligenceThe possibility of AGI manifesting in the 21st century is low, but still anexistential threat to humanity. More important that how humanity deals withother life forms in our galaxy, guidelines for how to deal with AGI should itever manifest needs also to be constructed. As for artificial intelligence inthe current era, itâ€™s impossible to regulate.We need better AI to moderate and regulate AI. Itâ€™s exponential growth in howmachine intelligence and algorithms are impacting us is a very difficult topicconsidering the lack of checks and balances in capitalism. Itâ€™s likely thatthe 2020s are a very messy decade in terms of how humanity is hacked bycorporations. It could realistically lead to a surveillance architecture thatour parents might easily consider a dystopia.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","Microsoft unveiled a [curriculum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/ai-business-school-government/) in its Artificial IntelligenceBusiness School this week that is specifically tailored for governmentdecision-makers.â€œThe fact is that government workers across the boardâ€”and especially decision-makersâ€”donâ€™t necessarily have that familiarity or depth on AI,â€ù AnthonySalcito, Microsoftâ€™s vice president for government, said in a[statement](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai-for-business/2019/05/27/government-ai-school/?utm_source=ai-blog&utm_campaign=1735). â€œThis new learning path is away to get them introduced to the concept and to understand why itâ€™s importantin the context of government work.â€ùThe tech giant launched its AI Business School in March to help executives andother business leaders better understand how to implement the technologythrough a free online master class. Now that more than 140,000 people havegained practical guidance from the AI course material to date, the company isoffering a new path that is designed especially for government agencies.Through various course modules, government insiders can learn about thecomponents that comprise a strong AI strategy, principles to guide responsibleAI adoption, lessons on fostering an â€œAI-readyâ€ù culture and other insightsaround using the tech to better serve their constituents.The course content also includes a case study demonstrating how a city inFinland has integrated AI to more efficiently serve citizens and a demo thatshowcases how the government can utilize intelligent bots to help constituentsaccess needed resources, among other materials and a video lecture.Microsoft is also expressly gearing the curriculum to governments of all sizesand Salcito said the new learning path is motivated by Microsoftâ€™s â€œkeypriority,â€ù which is to help the government serve its constituents throughcloud services.â€œWe believe this course is valuable for government decision-makers at alllevels â€” from small municipalities to large cities,â€ù Salcito said. â€œThe beautyof artificial intelligence technologies is their scalability.â€ù",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","_[Soraya Roberts](https://longreads.com/author/sorayanroberts/) | Longreads |May 2019 | 8 minutes (2,228 words)_â€œWell, thatâ€™s a really important thing to investigate.â€ù While Naomi Wolfâ€™sintellectual side failed her last week, her public side did not.

Hearing this go down,journalists like me theorized how we would react in similar circumstances(defenestration) and decried the lack of fact-checkers in publishing (fact:Authors often[ have to pay ](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/journalism-book-fact-checking-jill-abramson.php)for their own). The mistake did, however,ironically, offer one corrective: It turned Wolf from cerebral superhero intomere mortal. No longer was she an otherworldly intellect who could suddenlycomplete her Ph.D. â€” abandoned at Oxford when she was a Rhodes Scholar in themid-â€™80s, _Outrages_ is a reworking of her second, successful, attempt â€” whilejuggling columns for outlets like _The Guardian_ , a speaking circuit, aninstitute for ethical leadership, and her own site, DailyClout, not to mentiona new marriage. Something had to give, and it was the Victorians.Once, the public intellectual had the deserved reputation of a scholarlyindividual who steered the public discourse: I always think of Oscar Wilde,the perfect dinner wit who could riff on any subject on command and always hadthe presence of mind to come up with an immortal line like, â€œOne can surviveeverything nowadays except death.â€ù The public intellectual now has no time fordinner. Wolf, for instance, parlayed the success of her 1991 book _The BeautyMyth_ into an intellectual career that has spanned three decades, multiplebooks, and a couple of political advisory jobs, in which time her supposedexpertise has spread far beyond third-wave feminism. She has become a symbolof intellectual rigor that spans everything from vaginas to dictatorships â€” asort of lifestyle brand for the brain. Other thought leaders like her includeJordan Peterson, Fareed Zakaria, and Jill Abramson. Their minds have hijackedthe public trust, each one acting as the pinnacle of intellect, an individualexample of brilliance to cut through all the dullness, before sacrificing thevery rigor that put them there in order to maintain the illusion floated bythe media, by them, even by us. The public intellectual once meant publicaction, a voice from the outside shifting the inside, but then it becamepersonal, populated by self-serving insiders. The public intellectual thusbecame an extension â€” rather than an indictment â€” of the American Dream, theidea that one person, on their own, can achieve anything, including being thesmartest person in the room as well as the richest.* * *I accuse the Age of Enlightenment of being indirectly responsible for _[12Rules for Life](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/)_. Theincreasingly literate population of the 18th century was primed to live up tothe eraâ€™s ultimate aspiration: an increasingly informed public. This was atime of debates, public lectures, and publications and fame for the academicsbehind them. Ralph Waldo Emerson, for one. In his celebrated [â€œThe AmericanScholarâ€ù](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/nature-addresses-lectures/addresses/the-american-scholar/) speech from 1837, Emerson provided aframework for an American cultural identity â€” distinct from Europeâ€™s â€” whichwas composed of a multifaceted intellect (the One Man theory). â€œThe scholar isthat man who must take up into himself all the ability of the time, all thecontributions of the past, all the hopes of the future,â€ù he said. â€œIn yourselfslumbers the whole of Reason; it is for you to know all, it is for you to dareall.â€ù While Emerson argued that the intellectual was bound to action, theâ€œpublic intellectualâ€ù really arrived at the end of the 19th century, whenFrench novelist Ã‰mile Zola publicly accused the French military ofantisemitism over the Dreyfus Affair in an open letter published in _Lâ€™Aurore_newspaper in 1898. With[â€œJâ€™Accuseâ€_!,â€ù](https://www.marxists.org/archive/zola/1898/jaccuse.htm) thesocial commentary Zola spread through his naturalist novels was transformedinto a direct appeal to the public: Observational wisdom became intellectualaction. â€œI have but one passion: to enlighten those who have been kept in thedark, in the name of humanity which has suffered so much and is entitled tohappiness,â€ù he wrote. â€œMy fiery protest is simply the cry of my very soul.â€ùThe public intellectual thenceforth became the individual who used scholarshipfor social justice. But only briefly. After the Second World War, universitiesopened up to serve those who had served America, which lead to a boost ineducated citizens and a captive audience for philosophers and other scholars.By the end of the â€™60s, television commanded our attention further withlearned debates on _The Dick Cavett Show_ â€” where autodidact James Baldwinfamously dressed down Yale philosopher Paul Weiss â€” and _Firing Line_ withWilliam F. Buckley Jr. (also famously destroyed by Baldwin), which would go onto host academics like Camille Paglia in the â€™90s. But _[CultureTrip](https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/the-extinction-of-the-public-intellectual/)_ editor Michael Barron dates the â€œsplintering oftelevised American intellectualismâ€ù to a 1968 debate between Gore Vidal â€” â€œIwant to make 200 million people change their minds,â€ù the [â€œwriter-heroâ€ù once](https://newrepublic.com/article/122680/citizen-kane-literature)said â€” andBuckley, which devolved into playground insults. A decade later, the publicintellectual reached its celebrity peak, with Susan Sontag introducing thebranded brain in [_People_ magazine](https://people.com/archive/author-susan-sontag-rallies-from-dread-illness-to-enjoy-her-first-commercial-triumph-vol-9-no-11/) (â€œIâ€™m a book junkie. â€_ I buy special editions like other womenshop for designer originals at Saks.â€ù)As television lost patience with Vidalâ€™s verbose bravado, he was replaced withmore telegenic â€” angrier, stupider, more right-wing â€” white men like BillOâ€™Reilly, who did not clarify nuance but blustered over the issues of the day;the public intellectual was now all public, no intellect. Which is to say, thecelebrity pushed out the scholar, but it was on its way out anyway. By theâ€™80s, the communal philosophical and political conversations of the post-warera slunk back to the confines of academia, which became increasinglyprofessionalized, specialized, and insular, producing experts with lessgeneral and public-facing knowledge. â€œAnyone who engages in public debate as ascholar is at risk of being labelled not a serious scholar, someone who isdiverting their attention and resources away from research and publiclyseeking personal aggrandizement,â€ù one professor told _[UniversityAffairs](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/endangered-public-intellectual/)_ in 2014. â€œIt discourages people from participating at atime when public issues are more complicated and ethically fraught, morerequiring of diverse voices than ever before.â€ù Diversity rarely got past theivy, with the towering brilliance of trespassers like Baldwin and Zora NealeHurston, among other marginalized writers, limited by their circumstances.â€œThe white audience does not seek out black public intellectuals to challengetheir worldview,â€ù wrote Mychal Denzel Smith in_[Harperâ€™s](https://harpers.org/archive/2018/12/the-burden-of-the-black-public-intellectual/) _ last year, â€œinstead they are meant to serve as tourguides through a foreign experience that the white audience wishes to keep ata comfortable distance.â€ùSpeaking of white audiences â€_ hereâ€™s where I mention the intellectual dark webeven though I would rather not. Itâ€™s the place â€” online, outside the academy,in pseudo-intellectual â€œfree thoughtâ€ù mag _Quillette_ â€” where reactionaryâ€œintellectualsâ€ù flash their advanced degrees while claiming their views aretoo edgy for the schools that graduated them. These are your Petersons, yourSam Harrises, your Ben Shapiros, the white (non)thinkers, usually men, tied insome vague way to academia, which they use to validate their anti-intellectualism while passing their feelings off as philosophy and, worse, as(mis)guides for the misguided. Last month, a hyped debate between psychologyprofessor Peterson and philosopher Slavoj Å_iÅ_ek had the former spending hisopening remarks stumbling around Marxism, having only just read The CommunistManifesto for the first time since high school. As Andray Domise wrote in_[Macleanâ€™s](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-jordan-peterson-slavoj-zizek-was-good-for-something/)_ , â€œThe good professor hadnâ€™t done his homework.â€ù Butneither have his fans.But itâ€™s not just the conservative public intellectuals who are slacking off.Earlier this year, Jill Abramson, the former executive editor of _The New YorkTimes_ , published _Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight forFacts_. She was the foremost mind on journalism in the Trump era for roughlytwo seconds before being accused of plagiarizing parts of her book. Herresponse revealed that the authorship wasnâ€™t exactly hers alone, a fact whichonly came to light in order for her to blame others for her mistakes. â€œI didhave fact-checking, I did have assistants in research, and in some cases, thedrafting of parts of the book,â€ù[ she toldNPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/692409357/i-fell-short-jill-abramson-responds-to-charges-of-plagiarism-inaccuracies). â€œI certainly did spend money.But maybe it wasnâ€™t enough.â€ù Abramsonâ€™s explanation implied a tradition inwhich, if you are smart enough to be rich enough, you can pay to uphold yourintellectual reputation, no matter how artificial it may be.That certainly wasnâ€™t the first time a public intellectual overrepresentedtheir abilities. CNN host Fareed Zakaria, a specialist in foreign policy witha Ph.D. from Harvard â€” a marker of intelligence that can almost stand in foractual acumen these days â€” has been accused multiple times of plagiarism,despite â€œ[strippingdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/business/media/scandal-threatens-fareed-zakarias-image-as-media-star.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1)â€ù his extensiveworkload (books, speeches, columns, tweets). Yet he continues to host his ownshow and to write a column for _The Washington Post_ in the midst of a growingnumber of unemployed journalists and dwindling number of outlets. Which ispart of the problem. â€œWhat happens in the media is the cult of personality,â€ùsaid Charles R. Eisendrath, director of the Livingston Awards and Knight-Wallace Fellowship, in the _Times_. â€œAs long as itâ€™s cheaper to brandindividual personalities than to build staff and bolster their brand, theywill do it.â€ù Which is why Wolf, and even Abramson, are unlikely to be gone forgood.To be honest, we want them around. Media output hasnâ€™t contracted along withthe industry, so itâ€™s easier to follow an individual than a sprawling mediasite, just like itâ€™s easier to consult a YouTube beauty influencer than it isto browse an entire Sephora. With public intellectuals concealing the amountof work required of them, the pressure to live up to the myth we are allhelping to maintain only increases, since the rest of us have given up ontrying to keep pace with these superstars. They think better than we evercould, so why should we bother? Except that, like the human beings they are,theyâ€™re cutting corners and making errors and no longer have room to think theway they did when they first got noticed. It takes significant strength ofcharacter in this economy of nonstop (and precarious) work to bow out, but Ta-Nehisi Coates did when he stepped down last year from his columnist gig at_The Atlantic_ , where he had worked long before he started writing books andcomics. â€œI became the public face of the magazine in many ways and I donâ€™treally want to be that,â€ù he told _[The WashingtonPost](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/business/media/ta-nehisi-coates-atlantic.html)_. â€œI want to be a writer. Iâ€™m not a symbol of what _TheAtlantic_ wants to do or whatever.â€ù* * *Of course a public intellectual saw this coming. In a 1968 discussion betweenNorman Mailer and Marshall McLuhan on identity in the technology age (whichexplains the rise in STEM-based public intellectuals), the latter said, â€œWhenyou give people too much information, they resort to pattern recognition.â€ù Theindividuals who have since become symbols of thought â€” from the right(Christina Hoff Sommers) to the left (Roxane Gay) â€” are overrepresented in themedia, contravening the original definition of their role as outsiders whospur public action against the insiders. In a capitalist system that promotesbranded individualism at the expense of collective action, the publicintellectual becomes a myth of impossible aspiration that not even it can liveup to, which is the point â€” to keep selling a dream that is easier to buy thanto engage in reality. But an increasingly intelligent public is gainingground.The â€œPublic Intellectualâ€ù entry in _[UrbanDictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Public%20Intellectual)_defines it as, â€œA professor who spends too much time on Twitter,â€ù citingPeterson as an example. Ha? The entry is by OrinKerr, who may or may not be (Iam leaning toward the former) a legal scholar who writes for the conservative_Volokh Conspiracy_ blog. His bad joke is facetious, but not entirelyinaccurate â€” thereâ€™s a shift afoot, from the traditional individual publicintellectual toward a collective model. That includes online activists andwriters like Mikki Kendall, who regularly leads[discussions](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/xd5aq3/their-eyes-were-watching-twitter-0000317-v21n5) about feminism and race on Twitter; BillMcKibben, who cofounded [360.org](https://350.org/), an online community ofclimate change activists; and YouTubers like Natalie Wynn, whose[ContraPoints](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvsIonJdJ5E4EXMa65VYpA) videoessays respond to real questions from alt-right men. In both models, complexthought does not reside solely with the individual, but engages the community.This is a reversion to one of the early definitions of public intellectualismby philosopher Antonio Gramsci. â€œThe traditional and vulgarized type of theintellectual is given by the man of letters, the philosopher, the artist,â€ù hewrote in his[ PrisonNotebooks](http://marxism.halkcephesi.net/Antonio%20Gramsci/prison_notebooks/problems/intellectuals.htm)â€” first published in 1971. â€œThe mode of being of the new intellectual can nolonger consist in eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover offeelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, asconstructor, organizer, â€˜permanent persuaderâ€™ and not just a simple orator.â€ùIt doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re the smartest person in the room, as long as youcan make it move.* * *[Soraya Roberts](https://twitter.com/SorayaRoberts) is a culture columnist atLongreads.### Like this:Like Loading...### _Related_",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence https://t.co/0LJX1h5hGr #machinelearning,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial intelligence #AI  https://t.co/VjvNJ34lJT,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","#aiArtificial Intelligence https://t.co/d4xVi6ASB0",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence News Anchor,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","### Export Results as a new summarized PDFYou've made your search in thousands of documents, and you've found pagesabout your search in dozens of them.

Over the next fewyears, the technology will progress so far that AI will be employed infinancial institutions just as often as humans,â€ù said [SergeyPutyatinsky](https://mkb.ru/en/about/corporate-governance/management-board/putyatinskiy-sergey-evgenevich), deputy chairman of Credit Bank ofMoscow (CBoM)[](https://mkb.ru/en/about/corporate-governance/management-board/putyatinskiy-sergey-evgenevich). â€œActive use of AI technology will be adecisive factor in banksâ€™ competition in mass segments.â€ùAccording to a study conducted by the [local rating agency ExpertRA](https://www.raexpert.com/), in cooperation with the Centre for FinancialTechnologies, Russian banks most often use AI in credit analysis.Other areas where AI adoption has been increasing, according to the study, aredebt collection and marketing, including creation of individual [offers forcustomers](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252441507/One-fifth-of-global-banks-think-AI-will-boost-customer-experience).Meanwhile, the study revealed that Russian banks mostly put their hopes on AIin such areas as uncovering fraudulent transactions, debt collection andcredit scoring, while automating call centres by [introducing chatbots](https://searchcrm.techtarget.com/essentialguide/Guide-to-AI-in-customer-service-using-chatbots-and-NLP), using AI in algorithmic trading, [humanresources (HR)management](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/podcast/Testing-the-intelligence-of-AI-in-HR-applications) and remote customer identification aregenerally considered less promising.According to the studyâ€™s authors, however, the latter areas may notnecessarily be dismissed by lenders as unsuitable for AI adoption, but it isdifficult to come up with the returns on investment (ROI) from applying thetechnology to those areas. Meanwhile, Russian banks often prefer to adopt thetechnology by small steps.â€œWe are pragmatic about the adoption of â€˜hypedâ€™ technologies,â€ù saidPutyatinsky. â€œWe normally start with smaller-scale pilot projects that allowus to evaluate the potential usefulness of the technology and build up in-house competences.â€œWherever possible, we use open-source software. We make calculations forevery project to determine if it is financially viable and, based on that, wemake decisions on whether to greenlight it.â€ùAccording to Putyatinsky, CBoMâ€™s priority areas for AI technology areprocessing full-text documents, making loan decisions, dealing with over-duedebts and financial monitoring.Another major Russian lender, Rosbank, uses AI for processes involving [riskevaluation](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/feature/AI-in-insurance-forces-big-changes-to-traditional-industry), loan issuing, optimisation of thebranch network, uncovering fraud, communications and interaction withcustomers.â€œWe believe that over the next one to two years, AI will also be adopted forthe bankâ€™s other processes that are not directly linked to interaction withcustomers,â€ù said [Dmitry Smirnov, head of Rosbankâ€™s datalab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smirdm/?locale=de_DE).â€œAccumulating large amounts of data and the arrival of new data sources willfacilitate that. We are actively exploring areas where AI could be potentiallyadopted. These are processes aimed at improving the organisationâ€™s efficiencyand, from the customerâ€™s viewpoint, processes that simplify their interactionwith the bank.â€ùMeanwhile, Promsvyazbankâ€™s main area for AIâ€™s application includes creditdecision-making, uncovering fraud and forming offers for customers.â€œCurrently, we are working on broadening the scope of AI application,â€ù saidDaniil Tkach, head of the customer relations department at[Promsvyazbank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promsvyazbank).â€œIn the short term, automated systems will tell us which products would be thebest offer for a customer, what channels will be the most efficient and whatcommunication style will be most amenable to the customer.â€ùAccording to Tkach, the main conditions for wider spread of AI include asufficient degree of automation and manageability, reliable systems for datacollection and a sufficient number of reiterations of processes for learningpurposes. He said this is applicable for just about any banking processes,such as sales, communications, anti-fraud and operations.â€œWe could also single out intellectual management systems, in which AIsubstantially helps superiors to understand the quality of work by theiremployees and provides tips to all employees for possibly improving theirwork,â€ù Tkach said.Still, Russian banks often see AI as a technology that could help automate newareas rather than replace already existing automation solutions.â€œWe are not trying to revamp existing solutions,â€ù CBoMâ€™s Putyatinsky said.â€œInstead, we look at areas that have not yet been automated and startautomating them from scratch with the use of new technology.â€ù### __Obstacles to AI adoptionMeanwhile, the process of [adopting AI in the bankingsector](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252447328/Barclays-appointment-will-step-up-use-of-AI-in-investment-bank) is not always smooth. There are[obstacles in theway](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252452506/OpenStack-Foundation-will-tackle-infrastructure-barriers-to-enterprise-AI-adoption) of the technologyâ€™swider spread across the industry.According to the Expert RA study, those obstacles include discrepancies withdata in information systems, but once the issue of data consistency isresolved, finding qualified personnel to process data is set to be a majorchallenge.Industry insiders have already been complaining about difficulties in findingqualified personnel to operate AI-based solutions.â€œThe main factors that are impeding the adoption and development of AI areshortages of qualified professionals and problems with the infrastructure ofinformation systems,â€ù said Smirnov.Putyatinsky agreed, saying: â€œThe acutest issue is training of qualifiedpersonnel.â€ùTo help resolve this challenge, CBoM has been running an internship programmecalled [IB Universe](https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/artificial-intelligence-in-banking-industry-conversion-to-genuine-benefits/) for the past12 months. â€œThis allows students and recent graduates to acquire practicalexperience in various areas of investment business,â€ù added Putyatinsky.According to Putyatinsky, educational programmes of that kind will eventuallyallow banks to train personnel in the working environment, producing a newwave of employees who will already be prepared to deal with new technologies,such as AI and machine learning.Another issue with application of AI is complexity of the technologyâ€™salgorithms, Promsvyazbankâ€™s Tkach said. â€œContemporary [machine learningalgorithms](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/answer/How-do-machine-learning-algorithms-differ-from-traditional-algorithms) are so complex that humans haveproblems understanding decisions made by AI,â€ù he added.Over the next few years, progress with adopting AI systems in Russiaâ€™s bankingindustry is set to largely depend on investments in regional networks,personnel training and banksâ€™ ability to attract and retain customers,according to the Expert RA study.â€œThe good news is that at this point, a bank doesnâ€™t need to make enormousinvestment to become one of the [Russian banking industryâ€™s] AI leaders,â€ù saidthe studyâ€™s authors. â€œBut the bad news is that to achieve that, you have toact right now.â€ù",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","Computers which are capable of teaching themselves to predict premature deathcould greatly improve preventative healthcare in the future, suggests a newstudy by experts at the University of Nottingham.The team of healthcare data scientists and doctors have developed and tested asystem of computer-based 'machine learning' algorithms to predict the risk ofearly death due to chronic disease in a large middle-aged population.They found this AI system was very accurate in its predictions and performedbetter than the current standard approach to prediction developed by humanexperts. The study is published by _PLOS ONE_ in a special collections editionof ""Machine Learning in Health and Biomedicine"".The team used health data from just over half a million people aged between 40and 69 recruited to the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 and followed up until2016.Leading the work, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Data Science, DrStephen Weng, said: ""Preventative healthcare is a growing priority in thefight against serious diseases so we have been working for a number of yearsto improve the accuracy of computerised health risk assessment in the generalpopulation. Most applications focus on a single disease area but predictingdeath due to several different disease outcomes is highly complex, especiallygiven environmental and individual factors that may affect them.""We have taken a major step forward in this field by developing a unique andholistic approach to predicting a person's risk of premature death by machine-learning. This uses computers to build new risk prediction models that takeinto account a wide range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lifestylefactors for each individual assessed, even their dietary consumption of fruit,vegetables and meat per day.""We mapped the resulting predictions to mortality data from the cohort, usingOffice of National Statistics death records, the UK cancer registry and'hospital episodes' statistics. We found machine learned algorithms weresignificantly more accurate in predicting death than the standard predictionmodels developed by a human expert.""The AI machine learning models used in the new study are known as 'randomforest' and 'deep learning'. These were pitched against the traditionally-used'Cox regression' prediction model based on age and gender - found to be theleast accurate at predicting mortality - and also a multivariate Cox modelwhich worked better but tended to over-predict risk.Professor Joe Kai, one of the clinical academics working on the project, said:""There is currently intense interest in the potential to use 'AI' or 'machine-learning' to better predict health outcomes. In some situations we may find ithelps, in others it may not. In this particular case, we have shown that withcareful tuning, these algorithms can usefully improve prediction.""These techniques can be new to many in health research, and difficult tofollow. We believe that by clearly reporting these methods in a transparentway, this could help with scientific verification and future development ofthis exciting field for health care.""This new study builds on previous work by the Nottingham team which showedthat four different AI algorithms, 'random forest', 'logistic regression','gradient boosting' and 'neural networks', were significantly better atpredicting cardiovascular disease than an established algorithm used incurrent cardiology guidelines. This earlier study is available here.The Nottingham researchers predict that AI will play a vital part in thedevelopment of future tools capable of delivering personalised medicine,tailoring risk management to individual patients. Further research requiresverifying and validating these AI algorithms in other population groups andexploring ways to implement these systems into routine healthcare.###**Disclaimer:** AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy ofnews releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for theuse of any information through the EurekAlert system.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","This video is the product of Dessa Engineers, Hashiam Kadhim, Joseph Palermo,and Rayhane Mama.The Engineers used artificial intelligence to recreate Joe Roganâ€™s voice,generating the most human-like voice synthesis to date.

However,making the leap from theoretical to practical has proved challenging.Nuclear fusion, unlike fission, which is what takes place in traditionalreactors, involves smashing particles together and turning them into plasma togenerate energy. This takes place in what is called a magnetic fusion machine,or a tokamak. The tokamak produces magnetic fields that keep the superhotplasma inside and keep it movingâ€”and hotâ€”but controlling it for ever-longerperiods of time and making it move faster to produce more energy has been a[challenge](https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-recipe-for-nuclear-fusion-could-point-the-way-to-more-efficient-power).Many believe we will never be able to make nuclear fusion happen, butresearchers are not giving up. Computer technology is a natural ally toscientists in this quest for infinite clean power, but the presence of data tofeed into the computers has proved crucial.The Princeton and Harvard scientists used data from two fusion reactors: theDepartment of Energyâ€™s DIII-D National Fusion Facility in California, operatedby General Atomics, and the Joint European Torus tokamak in the UK. What theteam learns about predicting outages will be applied to the largest tokamakthat is currently in construction in the ITER project in Europe. It may justhelp solve fusionâ€™s biggest problem: why the particle smashing sometimesstops. If this problem is solved, the world could see a working nuclearreactor in less than 20 years, although many scientists and observers remainskeptical.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com **More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:**##### Download The Free Oilprice App Today[![](/a/img/cl/app/appstoredownload.svg)](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/oilprice/id1389772617?mt=8)[![](/a/img/cl/app/androidbutton.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=oilprice.android.app)[Back to homepage](https://oilprice.com/)",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","![Masahiro Fujita in a hospital bed, with a breathing tube. In front of him isa monitor plastered with Japanese signs.](//media.nature.com/w800/magazine-assets/d41586-019-01328-x/d41586-019-01328-x_16672812.jpg)People with paralysing conditions such as motor-neuron disease often rely ontechnology to help them speak.Credit: BJ Warnick/AlamyIn an effort to provide a voice for people who canâ€™t speak, neuroscientistshave designed a device that can transform brain signals into speech.This technology isnâ€™t yet accurate enough for use outside the lab, although itcan synthesize whole sentences that are mostly intelligible. Its creatorsdescribed their speech-decoding device in a study1 published on 24 April in_Nature_.Scientists have previously used artificial intelligence to translate singlewords2,3, mostly consisting of one syllable, from brain activity, says ChethanPandarinath, a neuroengineer at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who co-wrote a [commentary](https://preview-www.nature.com/platform/rh/preview/page/nature/brain-implants-that-let-you-speak-your-mind/16645644?view=fragmentPreview) accompanying the study. â€œMakingthe leap from single syllables to sentences is technically quite challengingand is one of the things that makes the current work so impressive,â€ù he says.## Mapping movementsMany people who have lost the ability to speak communicate using technologythat requires them to make tiny movements to control a cursor that selectsletters or words on a screen. UK physicist Stephen Hawking, who had motor-neuron disease, was one famous example. He used a speech-generating deviceactivated by a muscle in his cheek, says study leader Edward Chang, aneurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco.Because people who use such devices must type out words letter by letter,these devices can be very slow, producing up to ten words per minute, Changsays. Natural spoken speech averages 150 words per minute. â€œItâ€™s theefficiency of the vocal tract that allows us to do that,â€ù he says. And soChang and his team decided to model the vocal system when constructing theirdecoder.![A hand holding an array of intracranial electrodes: a palm-sized sheet ofplastic studded with metal, attached towires.](//media.nature.com/w800/magazine-assets/d41586-019-01328-x/d41586-019-01328-x_16672810.jpg)Researchers implanted electrodes similar to these in participantsâ€™ skulls torecord their brain signals.Credit: UCSFThe researchers worked with five people who had electrodes implanted on thesurface of their brains as part of epilepsy treatment. First, the teamrecorded brain activity as the participants read hundreds of sentences aloud.Then, Chang and his colleagues combined these recordings with data fromprevious experiments that determined how movements of the tongue, lips, jawand larynx created sound.The team trained a deep-learning algorithm on these data, and thenincorporated the program into their decoder. The device transforms brainsignals into estimated movements of the vocal tract, and turns these movementsinto synthetic speech. People who listened to 101 synthesized sentences couldunderstand 70% of the words on average, Chang says.### Two examples of a participant reading a sentence, followed by thesynthesized version of the sentence generated from their brain activity.[Download MP3](/magazine-assets/d41586-019-01328-x/d41586-019-01328-x_16672814.wav)Credit: Chang lab, UCSF Dept. of NeurosurgeryIn another experiment, the researchers asked one participant to read sentencesaloud and then to mime the same sentences by moving their mouth withoutproducing sound. The sentences synthesized in this test were of lower qualitythan those created from audible speech, Chang says, but the results are stillencouraging.## Intelligible futureSpeech created by mapping brain activity to movements of the vocal tract andtranslating them to sound is more easily understood than that produced bymapping brain activity directly to sound, says Stephanie RiÃ¨s, aneuroscientist at San Diego State University in California.But itâ€™s unclear whether the new speech decoder would work with words thatpeople only think, says Amy Orsborn, a neural engineer at the University ofWashington in Seattle. â€œThe paper does a really good job of showing that thisworks for mimed speech,â€ù she says. â€œBut how would this work when someoneâ€™s notmoving their mouth?â€ùMarc Slutzky, a neurologist at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois,agrees and says that the decoderâ€™s performance leaves room for improvement. Henotes that listeners identified the synthesized speech by selecting words froma set of choices; as the number of choices increased, people had more troubleunderstanding the words.The study â€œis a really important step, but thereâ€™s still a long way to gobefore synthesized speech is easily intelligibleâ€ù, Slutzky says.**Sign up for the daily Nature Briefing email newsletter**Stay up to date with what matters in science and why, handpicked from Natureand other publications worldwide.[Sign Up](https://www.nature.com/briefing/signup/)",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","Milan, March 14, 2019 - A group at Politecnico di Milano has developed anelectronic circuit able to solve a system of linear equations in a singleoperation in the timescale of few tens of ns. The performance of this newcircuit is superior not only to the classical digital computers, but also tothe futuristic quantum computers: it will be soon possible to develop a newgeneration of computing accelerators that will revolutionize the technology ofartificial intelligence.Solving a system of linear equations means finding the unknown vector x whichsatisfies the equation Ax = b, where A is a matrix of coefficients and b is aknown vector. To solve this problem, a conventional digital computer executesan algorithm which takes several operations, thus translating intoconsiderable time and energy consumption.The new circuit, which has been developed in the frame of the ERC Europeanproject RESCUE (Resistive switch computing beyond CMOS), solves systems oflinear equations (Ax=b) thanks to an innovative method of in-memory computing,where the coefficients of matrix A are stored in a special device calledmemristor. The memristor is able to store analogue values, thus a memristormatrix can physically map a coefficient matrix A within the circuit, thusstrongly accelerating the computation.The memristor array has been developed at the Clean Room of the Center formicro and nano fabrication Polifab of Politecnico di Milano. The memristorcircuit has been tested and validated on a wide set of algebraic problems,such as the ranking of internet websites and the solution of complicateddifferential equations, such as the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the computationof the quantum wavefunction for an electron. All these problems are solved ina single operation.These results have been published on the prestigious journal PNAS of theNational Academy of Science of the USA.

(Photo Credit: U.S. ArmyShutterstock) [VIEWORIGINAL](https://www.army.mil/e2/c/images/2019/05/20/553393/original.jpg""View Original"")RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. -- A project of the U.S. Army has developed a newframework for deep neural networks that allows artificial intelligence systemsto better learn new tasks while forgetting less of what they have learnedregarding previous tasks.The North Carolina State University researchers, funded by the Army, have alsodemonstrated that using the framework to learn a new task can make the AIbetter at performing previous tasks, a phenomenon called backward transfer.""The Army needs to be prepared to fight anywhere in the world so itsintelligent systems also need to be prepared,"" said Dr. Mary Anne Fields,program manager for Intelligent Systems at Army Research Office, an element ofU.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command's Army Research Lab. ""Weexpect the Army's intelligent systems to continually acquire new skills asthey conduct missions on battlefields around the world without forgettingskills that have already been trained. For instance, while conducting an urbanoperation, a wheeled robot may learn new navigation parameters for dense urbancities, but it still needs to operate efficiently in a previously encounteredenvironment like a forest.""The research team proposed a new framework, called Learn to Grow, forcontinual learning, which decouples network structure learning and modelparameter learning. In experimental testing it outperformed perviousapproaches to continual learning.""Deep neural network AI systems are designed for learning narrow tasks,"" saidXilai Li, a co-lead author of the paper and a Ph.D. candidate at NC State. ""Asa result, one of several things can happen when learning new tasks, systemscan forget old tasks when learning new ones, which is called catastrophicforgetting. Systems can forget some of the things they knew about old tasks,while not learning to do new ones as well. Or systems can fix old tasks inplace while adding new tasks -- which limits improvement and quickly leads toan AI system that is too large to operate efficiently. Continual learning,also called lifelong-learning or learning-to-learn, is trying to address theissue.""To understand the Learn to Grow framework, think of deep neural networks as apipe filled with multiple layers. Raw data goes into the top of the pipe, andtask outputs come out the bottom. Every ""layer"" in the pipe is a computationthat manipulates the data in order to help the network accomplish its task,such as identifying objects in a digital image. There are multiple ways ofarranging the layers in the pipe, which correspond to different""architectures"" of the network.When asking a deep neural network to learn a new task, the Learn to Growframework begins by conducting something called an explicit neuralarchitecture optimization via search. What this means is that as the networkcomes to each layer in its system, it can decide to do one of four things:skip the layer; use the layer in the same way that previous tasks used it;attach a lightweight adapter to the layer, which modifies it slightly; orcreate an entirely new layer.This architecture optimization effectively lays out the best topology, orseries of layers, needed to accomplish the new task. Once this is complete,the network uses the new topology to train itself on how to accomplish thetask -- just like any other deep learning AI system.""We've run experiments using several datasets, and what we've found is thatthe more similar a new task is to previous tasks, the more overlap there is interms of the existing layers that are kept to perform the new task,"" Li said.""What is more interesting is that, with the optimized -- or ""learned"" topology-- a network trained to perform new tasks forgets very little of what itneeded to perform the older tasks, even if the older tasks were not similar.""The researchers also ran experiments comparing the Learn to Grow framework'sability to learn new tasks to several other continual learning methods, andfound that the Learn to Grow framework had better accuracy when completing newtasks.To test how much each network may have forgotten when learning the new task,the researchers then tested each system's accuracy at performing the oldertasks -- and the Learn to Grow framework again outperformed the othernetworks.""In some cases, the Learn to Grow framework actually got better at performingthe old tasks,"" said Caiming Xiong, the research director of SalesforceResearch and a co-author of the work. ""This is called backward transfer, andoccurs when you find that learning a new task makes you better at an old task.We see this in people all the time; not so much with AI.""""This Army investment extends the current state of the art machine learningtechniques that will guide our Army Research Laboratory researchers as theydevelop robotic applications, such as intelligent maneuver and learning torecognize novel objects,"" Fields said. ""This research brings AI a step closerto providing our warfighters with effective unmanned systems that can bedeployed in the field.""The paper, ""Learn to Grow: A Continual Structure Learning Framework forOvercoming Catastrophic Forgetting,"" will be presented at the 36thInternational Conference on Machine Learning, being held June 9-15 in LongBeach, California. Co-lead authors of the paper are Tianfu Wu, Ph.D., anassistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at NC State, XilaiLi, a doctoral student at NC State, and Yingbo Zhou of Salesforce Research.The paper was co-authored by Richard Socher and Caiming Xiong of SalesforceResearch.The work was also supported by the National Science Foundation. Part of thework was done while Li was a summer intern at Salesforce AI Research.________________________________________The CCDC Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is an element of the U.S. Army CombatCapabilities Development Command.

The President wasinformed about the school by Head of Sberbank German Gref and school PrincipalSvetlana Infimovskaya.The students of the school can study the following areas: Algorithms,Graphics, Mobile Development, Computer Security, Robot Technology, andArtificial Intelligence to name a few. The school has 940 students today.Every year 1,000 software specialists will graduate from the school. Onaverage, students are expected to study for 2â€“3.5 years. The course includestwo practical training sessions in relevant companies for six months or more.*** * *** **Opening remarks at the meeting on the development of artificialintelligence technologies** **President of Russia Vladimir Putin:** Good afternoon, colleagues.Today I suggest that we discuss concrete steps that will form the foundationfor our National Strategy on the development of artificial intelligencetechnologies. We have repeatedly spoken about the need for such acomprehensive document. I also mentioned it in this yearâ€™s Address to theFederal Assembly. This is indeed one of the key areas of technologicaldevelopment that determines and will continue to determine the future of theentire world.The artificial intelligence mechanisms will allow for quick real-timedecision-making based on analysing vast amounts of information known as bigdata, which provides tremendous advantages in terms of quality andperformance. In addition, such mechanisms are unparalleled in history in termsof their impact on the economy and productivity, the effectiveness ofmanagement, education, healthcare and daily life.However, vying for technological leadership, primarily, in the sphere ofartificial intelligence â€“ and you are all very well aware of this, colleaguesâ€“ has already lead to global competition. New products and solutions are beingcreated at an exponential growth rate. I have said it before and I will say itnow: he who can establish a monopoly in artificial intelligence â€“ we are awareof the consequences â€“ will rule the world.It is no accident that many developed countries of the world have alreadyadopted action plans to develop such technologies. Of course, we must ensuretechnological sovereignty in the realm of artificial intelligence. This is themost important prerequisite for the viability of our businesses and theeconomy, the quality of life for Russian citizens, security and, finally, ourdefence capability. Here, we are not just talking about algorithms foraddressing individual and highly specialised problems; what we need areuniversal solutions, the use of which gives the optimum effect in anyindustry.In order to achieve such an ambitious goal in AI technology, we areobjectively positioned to have a good start and we have a serious competitiveedge. Today, Russia boasts one of the worldâ€™s highest penetration rates formobile communications and internet access, as well as for the development ofelectronic services. The cost of internet service in Russia is one of thelowest internationally. We also rely on traditionally strong scientific andeducation schools in mathematics and physics and a competitive system oftraining IT specialists. Incidentally, Russian students have won theInternational Programming Contest for the eighth year in a row. This year, itwas a team from Moscow State University.Strong scientific and applied competencies have already made it possible tocreate original and, most importantly, commercially viable world-class devicesin Russia, including in such areas as computer vision and voice recognition.We just saw this when our colleagues showed them to us, as well as cybersecurity. We have five years to achieve leading positions in these areas.Colleagues, what are the tasks that we need to focus on and prioritise in theStrategy based on Russian and international experience, as well as globaltrends? I will only list those that I believe should be a priority. I hope tohear from you as well. This is why we have gathered here today. We need tomake the Strategy complete and effective.The first priority is to lay conceptually new fundamental groundwork, createmathematical methods and operation principles for artificial intelligence,including those based on the human brain. Russia must become one of the keyplatforms for solving the most complicated scientific problems involvingscientists from all over the world. This work could also be performed by theinternational mathematics centres that will be opened in Moscow, St Petersburgand Sochi next year, as you may recall. In fact, they will complement thefacilities we already have. It is necessary to multiply the funding forartificial intelligence research and create incentives for private investmentand corporate science, research and development. We need to discuss this issuespecifically.Second. We need to build our workforce and intellectual potential, retain ourtalent and attract the best professionals from all over the world. There areactually many people working in this industry in Russia, but still much fewerthan in the countries that are pursuing leadership in this area. To securethis leadership, we need to develop study programmes in artificialintelligence at universities and colleges, including those in the regions.It is also important that we propose efficient mechanisms for monetaryincentives, comfortable working conditions, including remote work, for ourprogrammers, engineers and scientists and for the leading experts workingabroad who, as you know, include many Russians, and they are happy to returnto Russia and work with their colleagues here. Of course, when necessary, itis important to expedite any formalities related to citizenship, work permitsand other requirements.Third. It is absolutely important to bring our legislation up to date with thenew technological realities, to move quickly to take quality action to build aflexible and adequate legal framework for developing and applying AI-basedsolutions, as well as special regulations for private investment inbreakthrough solutions and, certainly, to guarantee solid protection ofintellectual property and legal conditions for patent registration in Russiaâ€™snational jurisdiction. I want to repeat that it is important to liftlegislative and administrative barriers for technological pioneering whileensuring the security of the state and society with full observance of ourcitizensâ€™ rights. There is room for improvement.Fourth. We need to build an efficient legal regulation for data circulation,advanced infrastructure for data processing and storage as well as proposebalanced solutions that will allow using data for developing AI algorithms.And, finally, the most important issue is whether our society and people areready for the pervasive implementation of this technology. It is necessary toprovide for mass digital literacy and re-training programmes â€“ especially insought-after jobs.Today Mr German Gref and I reviewed his school. It is indeed a great exampleof specialist training and promotion of interesting, promising startups ofgreat significance for almost all sectors. So let us begin with this point.<â€_>",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",How Artificial Intelligence will transform modern workplace - Artificial Intelligence is not https://t.co/tNTW3Cu9U6 #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",How Artificial Intelligence will transform modern workplace - Artificial Intelligence is not https://t.co/uHSEPCDsss #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Violence in Movies - Using Artificial Intelligence https://t.co/rh11iKAmk2 #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",New Artificial Intelligence Breast Imaging Technology Demonstrates Profound Potential - Artificial Intelligence https://t.co/b0Jd4CMHza #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",The limits of artificial intelligence in insurance - Artificial intelligence has no https://t.co/cercjGmZSY #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Is Artificial Intelligence a threat to Humans? - Artificial Intelligence in sim https://t.co/20FOvq0rQS #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Clarifying how artificial intelligence systems make choices - Artificial intelligence (AI) a https://t.co/Qd37tTPHEz #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","Artificial Intelligence Revolutionizing Technology in India#CTO #DL #Ml #HealthTechArtificial Intelligence (#AI)... https://t.co/fPElvlnZmK",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @into_AI: Data stewardship for artificial intelligence - Artificial intelligence (AI) i https://t.co/HCMrtWPjRX #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",What is Artificial Intelligence | Artificial Intelligence Tutorial For Beginners by @edurekain #ai... https://t.co/AbwB9uypte,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @into_AI: How Artificial Intelligence Could Humanize Healthcare - Using artificial intelligence https://t.co/iUlUGthk9o #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @nigewillson: Using Artificial Intelligence to Make Better Artificial Intelligence https://t.co/wyZJwJ1Ujr #ArtificialIntelligence #ai h...,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @into_AI: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Robots Industry - Artificial Intelligence (AI) R https://t.co/zkHipO6yo8 #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial intelligence helping matrimony sites suggest matches - Express Computer: Artificial intelligence helping... https://t.co/p846L9Ke5M,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Is Artificial Intelligence The Doom of Radiology? - Artificial intelligence (AI) w https://t.co/oNc6zUW3lb #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Promise vs Buzz - Artificial intelligence as we https://t.co/pfjHCysRai #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence Created An Entirely New Sport - Artificial intelligence has co https://t.co/9BFXJPi6uN #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @SuriyaSubraman: Artificial Intelligence Tools Makes Pricing Customer-Oriented | - https://t.co/4l4UjHEsze: Artificial Intelligence Tool...,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial intelligence in rail: Hype or reality? - Is artificial intelligence (AI https://t.co/t6WUpNap6r #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Building a Modern Enterprise with Artificial Intelligence - Use of artificial intelligence https://t.co/lcEGiK9D7O #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence And The Music Industrial Complex - Artificial Intelligence And Th https://t.co/jmz8Ucs16V #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @into_AI: Artificial intelligence diagnoses lung cancer - Artificial intelligence is bet https://t.co/GxSoUMwbW8 #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @SuriyaSubraman: Walmart Bolsters Artificial Intelligence Efforts - https://t.co/jjSFlcn0XX: Walmart Bolsters Artificial Intelligence Ef...,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence own sidekick Watson - https://t.co/Cpy6q8NEf1: Artificial Intelligence own sidekick Watson ... https://t.co/IIfcQ2OFhi,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @into_AI: How Will Artificial Intelligence Impact Healthcare? - Basic artificial intelligence https://t.co/vE2KTkEe35 #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @into_AI: Push to regulate artificial intelligence - Artificial intelligence is tak https://t.co/271VREQiNN #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @into_AI: Revolutionising manufacturing with artificial intelligence - Artificial intelligence is the https://t.co/rBgleDknoA #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",RT @into_AI: Revolutionising manufacturing with artificial intelligence - Artificial intelligence is the https://t.co/6Vwwhg9Vbe #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","**Rating is available when the video has been rented.**This feature is not available right now.

She (yes, she) was ableto construct arguments and make rebuttals and even used preprogrammed humor.â€œI have heard you hold the world record in debate competition wins againsthumans, but I suspect you have never debated a machine,â€ù Project Debater saidto Natarajan in her opening remarks. â€œWelcome to the future.â€ùIBM wants to use this technology to help people develop more persuasivearguments and make well-informed decisions, said Dan Lehav, computer scientistand a debate expert at the company. Humans are good at presenting informationin ways that appeal to other humans, he said. But machines have the ability toanalyze unfathomable amounts of data.â€œWe want to bridge those worlds,â€ù said Lehav. â€œHumans are going to be able touse this in a complementary way.â€ùVIDEOHe said the technology has several potential applications in higher education.College debate is an obvious area. Project Debater could be a practiceopponent, a research aid or even a judge of the strength of students'arguments -- including those written in essay form.What makes a â€œstrongâ€ù argument is something that IBM scientists have grappledwith, said Lehav. Project Debater determines whether there is substantialevidence for or against an argument by analyzing a corpus of more than 300million newspaper, magazine and journal articles.AI can â€œshine a light on distorted facts to provide diverse, well-informedviewpoints -- both the pro and the con,â€ù IBM said on its Project Debaterwebsite. â€œThe rise of one-sided and doctored narratives is challenging societyand our platforms. Too often, we talk past one another. We need a smarterway.â€ùBrandon Fleming, founder and CEO of the [Harvard Debate Council DiversityProject](https://www.harvarddcdp.org/about), said he is excited about thepotential applications of the technology in academe. â€œThe technology is simplyrevolutionary,â€ù he said in an email. â€œProject Debater has the potential toempower our ability to think critically and communicate effectively.â€ùFleming said he wants to use the technology to train college debaters inrhetoric, research and argumentation. â€œThe speed at which Project Debater cangenerate arguments would provide more content for my students to explore andcritique,â€ù he said. This would â€œinherently accelerate and enhance the amountof academic conditioning that one training session could allot -- producingstronger students in a shorter period of time.â€ùMore generally, he said the technology could be used in classrooms toencourage students to engage in critical examinations of research andargumentation. â€œIn addition to information, Project Debater provides instantaccess to reason. Information and reason coalesce into ideas and arguments.Argumentation is the vehicle by which ideas are exchanged, challenged andperfected.â€ùHowever, not everyone is enthusiastic about the potential of AI in collegedebate. Jeffrey Jarman, director of the Elliott School of Communication andformer director of debate at Wichita State University, said he could see arole for AI in helping students improve their debating skills, but with ""lotsof caveats and cautions.""""I""m not sure how much the AI understands the full process of argumentation,""said Jarman in an email. Debating is about more than just finding strongarguments, he said. ""We have to shape and alter our arguments based on theparticular audience we are speaking to. It isn't clear that the AI issophisticated enough to do that yet.""Scott Varda, associate professor of communication and associate director ofdebate at Baylor University, said the IBM technology was â€œimpressiveâ€ù but hadlimitations. In the live debate, Varda felt Project Debater struggled to graspnuance and lacked creativity. â€œDebate is both an art and a science,â€ù he said.While Project Debater could be used to train champion debaters, Varda doesnâ€™tthink this would be a scalable or particularly useful application of thetechnology. A better use might be tapping AIâ€™s analytical power to helpacademics mine scholarly literature, he said, perhaps to identify new drugtargets in medical research.Sarah Partlow-Lefevre, a professor of communications and director of debate atIdaho State University, agreed that Project Debaterâ€™s debating skills werelimited. She likened the AIâ€™s performance in the live debate to that of anovice debater. â€œIt was able to compile all the information but didnâ€™t knowhow to use it.""The AI started with an advantage over its human opponent because it had accessto a treasure trove of raw data and facts, said Partlow-Lefevre. But it felldown on connecting with the audience through humor, eye contact, delivery andsubtlety of argument. â€œIt didnâ€™t feel able to maintain a consistent policyposition and didnâ€™t quite understand the nuance of all the arguments,â€ù shesaid.Training regimes for college debaters are usually low-tech affairs, saidPartlow-Lefevre. Pen drills, where students speak while biting down on a pen,are used to help students improve their enunciation. Speed reading helpsstudents to process information faster. Students also are encouraged to filmthemselves and review the video to see where they can improve their delivery.AI could be a useful sparring partner for college debaters in training, orhelp them to conduct research, said Partlow-Lefevre. But she predicts that useof this technology in a competition setting would prove contentious. Incompetitions where students are given just minutes to prepare their arguments,even allowing access to the internet is unusual and deemed â€œverycontroversial.â€ùPartlow-Lefevre worries that access to the technology might only be availableto students at the wealthiest institutions -- possibly giving them an unfairadvantage over their opponents. She also questions whether the use of AI wouldbe deemed intellectually honest by college debate judges.The world of college debate ""is slow to change,"" she said.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) frequently require surprising amount of(tedious) manual work.

Interviews are held in â€œlightningroundâ€ù format, which are rapid interviews with tech experts for immediatedepth on each topic._Mastercard pioneered the idea of electronic payments, and in many regards, wasthe first â€œfintechâ€ù company in the market. With this follows greatresponsibility, especially as the Association of Certified Fraud Examinersreported a 42% frequency of fraud across small businesses costing an averageof 5% of gross revenues. Mastercard is using artificial intelligence andnatural language processing in unique ways to combat fraud and moneylaundering.In this podcast, Ann Cairns, Executive Vice Chairman of Mastercard discussesthe following ways AI can be used in the financial industry including how tofight fraud:  * AI can detect if someone has taken your phone and is using your banking applications as each person holds a phone unique to them including how a person holds their head and makes key strokes.  * Natural language processing can detect if money is being moved suspiciously and split, or recombined, in unnatural ways. Financial companies, including Mastercard, can light up the movements on a dashboard and track the money as if they were â€œtracking the spread of a virusâ€ù to help fight fraud.Cairns also discusses how small shopkeepers in emerging markets can accesscapital to grow businesses and the efforts Mastercard is making to create amore inclusive environment in the financial markets.VIDEOPlease Subscribe and Leave a Review for the Podcast Here**ABOUT MASTERCARD:**Mastercard has beaten many of the FANG stocks over the last year with a returnof 30% and is currently at $245 per share up from $175 at December lows. MAcan be described as having one foot in the present and one foot in the future.The business model has done well due to the â€œdisintermediation of cash/checksâ€ùand an increase of dominance in the payments eco-system, while also buildingout artificial intelligence opportunities and envisioning a future wherecredit cards and smartphones are not needed for more seamless payments throughthe use biometrics.Last month, Mastercard topped earnings estimates by reporting $1.78 earningsper share compared to the consensus of $1.66 EPS. The company had $3.89billion revenue for the quarter, up 9% from a year-ago quarter. Visa also beatearnings with an 8% revenue climb to $5.45 billion with $1.31 earnings pershare. Both Mastercard and Visa have been trading at record highs. Recently,Visa beat Mastercard in a bid to buy Earthport for $320 million.

However long it takes for true personalization to occur inretail marketing and advertising, each year AI becomes more important in theretail industry.According to some analysts, AI will boost profitability in retail andwholesale by nearly 60% by 2035!According to Retail Dive, retail spending on AI will reach $7.3 Billion by2022.Think about it though, Retail as an industry is expected to top [$3.8 Trillionin 2019, according to the NRF](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-retail-outlook/u-s-retail-sales-expected-to-top-3-8-trillion-in-2019-nrf-idUSKCN1PU1YM).#### Retail AI is still a Product thatâ€™s ImmatureEven with all this hype, in 2019 AI is still really not likely moving theneedle for retailers as much as one might think. Brands know thatrelationships matter. Advertising on Instagram is still trending.However AmazonGo-like stores are coming, and they will generally usher out theage of the cashier, and slowly but surely retail sales agents as well. Thisreally is thanks to AI, deep learning, LiDAR, facial recognition and computervision, among other things.Photo by [FranckV.](https://unsplash.com/@franckinjapan?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)In a study released in early 2019 by IBM at the National Retail Federationâ€™sbig show in New York, IBM identified the following six ways the retailindustry plans on utilizing AI, based on respondentsâ€™ feedback:  1. Supply chain planning (85%)  2. Demand forecasting (85%)  3. Customer intelligence (79%)  4. Marketing, advertising, and campaign management (75%)  5. Store operations (73%)  6. Pricing and promotion (73%)  * AI is impacting the retail industry across the board, but especially in logistics and business intelligence.### Retail is worth $3.8 Trillion in 2019U.S. retail sales are expected to rise between 3.8 percent and 4.4 percent tomore than $3.8 trillion in 2019.Meanwhile trends like buying online and picking up in store (BOPIS) are reallycatching on with brands like Costco, Walmart and so forth. E-commercepenetration in China and India means their retail sectors are prone to super-apps that are truly innovative for customer centric convenience.In the U.S. we are bloated with physical retail. Yet in recent years even thelikes of Alibaba, Amazon and JD.com are hitting brick-and-mortar stores with anew level of AI and machine intelligence. Retail experiences are changing dueto AI each and every day. We just donâ€™t necessarily â€œseeâ€ù it.#### The Retail Apocalypse Just Means Retail is at the Intersection of HumanActivityRetail is a symbol of how transformative the marketplace can be in humantechnology. Think about it, even with more than 6,000 stores slated to closein 2019, AI will also create new jobs in the retinal industry even ascashiers, shelf scanners, cleaners and other jobs are automated away by AI androbots.The only thing thatâ€™s really a retail apocalypse is how disruptive AI isbecoming in all human activities, and this includes all aspects of consumerismand capitalism broadly speaking. If you make below $20 an hour and your workis repetitive, it likely wonâ€™t exist in 2030 or 2035. The retail cashier andsales person might be having their last appearance in the next few decadesahead.### The Holy Grail of Retail PersonalizationConsumers say that a personalized shopping experience can inspire loyalty andincreases in spending. AI is augmenting and enhancing our retail experiences.This is why things like advertising for brands on Amazon also have such anincredible future, even as Googleâ€™s hold on advertising is showing signs ofdiminishing.Itâ€™s business as usual though in retail, brick-and-mortar retailers arenâ€™tmeeting consumersâ€™ in-store personalization expectations. Itâ€™s very hard toaugment the physical store experience. But the impact of VR and AR on retailis really very minimal. The impact of apps on shopping however is still hugeand might be just getting started.Some believe with regards to AI in retail that AI will have its biggest impacton personalization, search and chatbots. Deep learning and machineintelligence are rather new to retail, and it will take some time to see thefruits of some of these experiments and innovations.Photo by [PatrickTomasso](https://unsplash.com/@impatrickt?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)### The Lure of Real Retail StoresConsumers still want to shop in stores, they just want to shop in a differentway. AI is helping to facilitate what the new consumer wants and enjoys themost about the retail experience.As shoppers move their spending online and foot traffic to malls declines,legacy retailers have been forced to rethink their strategies and begin toadopt the winning ways of AI, personalization, and digital experiences thatwork and show a proven track record with Millennials and GenZ consumers.According to a study by Juniper Research, in the coming years retailers willspend heavily on AI tools that will enable them to differentiate and improvethe services they offer customers. These will include automated marketingplatforms that generate tailored, timely offers, and chatbots that provideinstant customer service.Photo by [BBHSingapore](https://unsplash.com/@bbh_singapore?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)### Automation & AI Means a Different LifeThe truth is however, AI might lead to re imagining the very concept ofshopping, work and human relationships, just as blockchain will help usrethink how we see money. All this to say that AI integration in retail is animportant step in the 4th industrial revolution and our move to a moreconnected Internet-of-Things smart home-smart city scenario. Retail drone androbot delivery is coming.AI will enhance the marketplace. These things just tend to take more time thanwe assume. AI needs a certain maturation of the Cloud, Point of Sale, Paymentsand so many other sub verticals for it to fully manifest. Having smarterrobots and a neural interface instead of clunky smartphones will also help.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","SAN FRANCISCO â€” In 2004, Geoffrey Hinton doubled down on his pursuit of atechnological idea called a neural network.It was a way for machines to see the world around them, recognize sounds andeven understand natural language. But scientists had spent more than 50 yearsworking on the concept of neural networks, and machines couldnâ€™t really do anyof that.Backed by the Canadian government, Dr. Hinton, a computer science professor atthe University of Toronto, organized a new research community with severalacademics who also tackled the concept. They included Yann LeCun, a professorat New York University, and Yoshua Bengio at the University of Montreal.On Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the worldâ€™s largestsociety of computing professionals, announced that Drs. Hinton, LeCun andBengio had won this yearâ€™s Turing Award for their work on neural networks. TheTuring Award, which was introduced in 1966, is often called the Nobel Prize ofcomputing, and it includes a $1 million prize, which the three scientists willshare.Over the past decade, the big idea nurtured by these researchers hasreinvented the way technology is built, accelerating the development of [face-recognition services](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/business/newspaper-shooting-facial-recognition.html?module=inline), [talking digitalassistants](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/17/technology/alexa-siri-conversation.html?module=inline), [warehouserobots](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/business/warehouse-robots-learning.html?module=inline) and [self-drivingcars](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/technology/self-driving-cars-aurora.html?module=inline). Dr. Hinton is now at Google, and Dr. LeCun worksfor Facebook. Dr. Bengio has inked deals with IBM and Microsoft.â€œWhat we have seen is nothing short of a paradigm shift in the science,â€ù saidOren Etzioni, the chief executive officer of the Allen Institute forArtificial Intelligence in Seattle and a prominent voice in the A.I.community. â€œHistory turned their way, and I am in awe.â€ùLoosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain, a [neuralnetwork](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/technology/google-artificial-intelligence.html?module=inline) is a complex mathematical system that canlearn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousandsof old phone calls, for example, it can learn to recognize spoken words.This allows many artificial intelligence technologies to progress at a ratethat was not possible in the past. Rather than coding behavior into systems byhand â€” one logical rule at a time â€” computer scientists can build technologythat learns behavior largely on its own.The London-born Dr. Hinton, 71, first embraced the idea as a graduate studentin the early 1970s, a time when most artificial intelligence researchersturned against it. Even his own Ph.D. adviser questioned the choice.â€œWe met once a week,â€ù Dr. Hinton said in an interview. â€œSometimes it ended ina shouting match, sometimes not.â€ùNeural networks had a brief revival in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After ayear of postdoctoral research with Dr. Hinton in Canada, the Paris-born Dr.LeCun moved to AT&Tâ€™s Bell Labs in New Jersey, where he designed a neuralnetwork that could read handwritten letters and numbers. An AT&T subsidiarysold the system to banks, and at one point it read about 10 percent of allchecks written in the United States.Though a neural network could read handwriting and help with some other tasks,it could not make much headway with big A.I. tasks, like recognizing faces andobjects in photos, identifying spoken words, and understanding the natural waypeople talk.â€œThey worked well only when you had lots of training data, and there were fewareas that had lots of training data,â€ù Dr. LeCun, 58, said.But some researchers persisted, including the Paris-born Dr. Bengio, 55, whoworked alongside Dr. LeCun at Bell Labs before taking a professorship at theUniversity of Montreal.In 2004, with less than $400,000 in funding from the Canadian Institute forAdvanced Research, Dr. Hinton created a research program dedicated to what hecalled â€œneural computation and adaptive perception.â€ù He invited Dr. Bengio andDr. LeCun to join him.By the end of the decade, the idea had caught up with its potential. In 2010,Dr. Hinton and his students helped Microsoft, IBM, and Google push theboundaries of speech recognition. Then they did much the same with imagerecognition.â€œHe is a genius and knows how to create one impact after another,â€ù said LiDeng, a former speech researcher at Microsoft who brought Dr. Hintonâ€™s ideasinto the company.Dr. Hintonâ€™s image recognition breakthrough was based on an algorithmdeveloped by Dr. LeCun. In late 2013, Facebook hired the N.Y.U. professor tobuild a research lab around the idea. Dr. Bengio resisted offers to join oneof the big tech giants, but the research he oversaw in Montreal helped drivethe progress of [systems that aim to understand naturallanguage](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/technology/artificial-intelligence-language.html?module=inline) and technology that can [generatefake photos that are indistinguishable from the realthing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/02/technology/ai-generated-photos.html?module=inline).Though these systems have undeniably accelerated the progress of artificialintelligence, they are still a very long way from true intelligence. But Drs.Hinton, LeCun and Bengio believe that new ideas will come.â€œWe need fundamental additions to this toolbox we have created to reachmachines that operate at the level of true human understanding,â€ù Dr. Bengiosaid.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","Computers which are capable of teaching themselves to predict premature deathcould greatly improve preventative healthcare in the future, suggests a newstudy by experts at the University of Nottingham.The team of healthcare data scientists and doctors have developed and tested asystem of computer-based 'machine learning' algorithms to predict the risk ofearly death due to chronic disease in a large middle-aged population.They found this AI system was very accurate in its predictions and performedbetter than the current standard approach to prediction developed by humanexperts. The study is published by _PLOS ONE_ in a special collections editionof ""Machine Learning in Health and Biomedicine.""The team used health data from just over half a million people aged between 40and 69 recruited to the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 and followed up until2016.Leading the work, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Data Science, DrStephen Weng, said: ""Preventative healthcare is a growing priority in thefight against serious diseases so we have been working for a number of yearsto improve the accuracy of computerised health risk assessment in the generalpopulation. Most applications focus on a single disease area but predictingdeath due to several different disease outcomes is highly complex, especiallygiven environmental and individual factors that may affect them.""We have taken a major step forward in this field by developing a unique andholistic approach to predicting a person's risk of premature death by machine-learning. This uses computers to build new risk prediction models that takeinto account a wide range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lifestylefactors for each individual assessed, even their dietary consumption of fruit,vegetables and meat per day.""We mapped the resulting predictions to mortality data from the cohort, usingOffice of National Statistics death records, the UK cancer registry and'hospital episodes' statistics. We found machine learned algorithms weresignificantly more accurate in predicting death than the standard predictionmodels developed by a human expert.""The AI machine learning models used in the new study are known as 'randomforest' and 'deep learning'. These were pitched against the traditionally-used'Cox regression' prediction model based on age and gender -- found to be theleast accurate at predicting mortality -- and also a multivariate Cox modelwhich worked better but tended to over-predict risk.Professor Joe Kai, one of the clinical academics working on the project, said:""There is currently intense interest in the potential to use 'AI' or 'machine-learning' to better predict health outcomes. In some situations we may find ithelps, in others it may not. In this particular case, we have shown that withcareful tuning, these algorithms can usefully improve prediction.""These techniques can be new to many in health research, and difficult tofollow. We believe that by clearly reporting these methods in a transparentway, this could help with scientific verification and future development ofthis exciting field for health care.""This new study builds on previous work by the Nottingham team which showedthat four different AI algorithms, 'random forest', 'logistic regression','gradient boosting' and 'neural networks', were significantly better atpredicting cardiovascular disease than an established algorithm used incurrent cardiology guidelines. This earlier study is available here.The Nottingham researchers predict that AI will play a vital part in thedevelopment of future tools capable of delivering personalised medicine,tailoring risk management to individual patients. Further research requiresverifying and validating these AI algorithms in other population groups andexploring ways to implement these systems into routine healthcare.**Story Source:**[Materials](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2019/mar/artificial-intelligence-can-predict-premature-death-study-finds.aspx) provided by[**University of Nottingham**](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk). _Note: Contentmay be edited for style and length._",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","_**Summary:** Artificial intelligence technology is able to objectivelydifferentiate between those with PTSD and those without by analyzing speechsamples, with 89.1% accuracy._ **Source:** NYU Langone Health **A specially designed computer program can help diagnose post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD) in veterans by analyzing their voices, a new studyfinds.**Published online April 22 in the journal _Depression and Anxiety_ , the studyfound that an artificial intelligence tool can distinguish â€“ with 89 percentaccuracy â€“ between the voices of those with or without PTSD.â€œOur findings suggest that speech-based characteristics can be used todiagnose this disease, and with further refinement and validation, may beemployed in the clinic in the near future,â€ù says senior study author CharlesR. Marmar, MD, the Lucius N. Littauer Professor and chair of the Department ofPsychiatry at NYU School of Medicine.More than 70 percent of adults worldwide experience a traumatic event at somepoint in their lives, with up to 12 percent of people in some strugglingcountries suffering from PTSD. Those with the condition experience strong,persistent distress when reminded of a triggering event.The study authors say that a PTSD diagnosis is most often determined byclinical interview or a self-report assessment, both inherently prone tobiases. This has led to efforts to develop objective, measurable, physicalmarkers of PTSD progression, much like laboratory values for medicalconditions, but progress has been slow. **Learning How to Learn**In the current study, the research team used a statistical/machine learningtechnique, called random forests, that has the ability to â€œlearnâ€ù how toclassify individuals based on examples. Such AI programs build â€œdecisionâ€ùrules and mathematical models that enable decision-making with increasingaccuracy as the amount of training data grows.The researchers first recorded standard, hours-long diagnostic interviews,called Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, or CAPS, of 53 Iraq and Afghanistanveterans with military-service-related PTSD, as well as those of 78 veteranswithout the disease. The recordings were then fed into voice software from SRIInternational â€“ the institute that also invented Siri â€“ to yield a total of40,526 speech-based features captured in short spurts of talk, which theteamâ€™s AI program sifted through for patterns.The random forest program linked patterns of specific voice features withPTSD, including less clear speech and a lifeless, metallic tone, both of whichhad long been reported anecdotally as helpful in diagnosis. While the currentstudy did not explore the disease mechanisms behind PTSD, the theory is thattraumatic events change brain circuits that process emotion and muscle tone,which affects a personâ€™s voice.Moving forward, the research team plans to train the AI voice tool with moredata, further validate it on an independent sample, and apply for governmentapproval to use the tool clinically.â€œSpeech is an attractive candidate for use in an automated diagnostic system,perhaps as part of a future PTSD smartphone app, because it can be measuredcheaply, remotely, and non-intrusively,â€ù says lead author Adam Brown, PhD,adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU School ofMedicine.â€œThe speech analysis technology used in the current study on PTSD detectionfalls into the range of capabilities included in our speech analytics platformcalled SenSay Analyticsâ„¢,â€ù says Dimitra Vergyri, director of SRIInternationalâ€™s Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory. â€œThesoftware analyzes words â€“ in combination with frequency, rhythm, tone, andarticulatory characteristics of speech â€“ to infer the state of the speaker,including emotion, sentiment, cognition, health, mental health andcommunication quality. The technology has been involved in a series ofindustry applications visible in startups like Oto, Ambit and Decoded Health.â€ù[![](//i1.wp.com/neurosciencenews.com/files/2019/04/ptsd-deep-learning-voice-neuroscienccneews.jpg?resize=750%2C404&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/neurosciencenews.com/files/2019/04/ptsd-deep-learning-voice-neuroscienccneews.jpg?ssl=1)The study authors say that a PTSD diagnosis is most often determined byclinical interview or a self-report assessment, both inherently prone tobiases.

Both approaches are subject tounderâ€ê and overâ€êreporting of symptoms. An objective test is lacking. We havedeveloped a classifier of PTSD based on objective speechâ€êmarker features thatdiscriminate PTSD cases from controls. **Methods**Speech samples were obtained from warzoneâ€êexposed veterans, 52 cases with PTSDand 77 controls, assessed with the Clinicianâ€êAdministered PTSD Scale.Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) were excluded. Audiorecordings of clinical interviews were used to obtain 40,526 speech featureswhich were input to a random forest (RF) algorithm. **Results**The selected RF used 18 speech features and the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.954. At aprobability of PTSD cut point of 0.423, Youdenâ€™s index was 0.787, and overallcorrect classification rate was 89.1%. The probability of PTSD was higher formarkers that indicated slower, more monotonous speech, less change intonality, and less activation. Depression symptoms, alcohol use disorder, andTBI did not meet statistical tests to be considered confounders. **Conclusions**This study demonstrates that a speechâ€êbased algorithm can objectivelydifferentiate PTSD cases from controls. The RF classifier had a high AUC.Further validation in an independent sample and appraisal of the classifier toidentify those with MDD only compared with those with PTSD comorbid with MDDis required.Feel free to share this Neuroscience News.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","**More awesome ebooks for you.** Packt is back for our newest book bundle!

The term is frequently applied to the project ofdeveloping systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic ofhumans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learnfrom past experience. Since the development of the Computer in the 1940s , ithas been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out verycomplex tasks with great proficiency. On the other hand, some programs haveattained the performance levels of human experts and professionals inperforming certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in thislimited sense is found in applications as diverse as Medical diagnosis ,Computer Search Engines and Voice or Handwriting recognition.Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components ofintelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving,[perception](https://www.britannica.com/topic/perception), and using language.LEARNINGThere are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificialintelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error.REASONINGTo reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation. Inferences areclassified as either deductive or inductive.PROBLEM SOLVINGProblem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterizedas a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reachsome predefined goal or solution.PERCEPTIONIn perception the environment is scanned by means of various sensory organs,real or artificial, and the scene is decomposed into separate objects invarious spatial relationships.LANGUAGEA language is a system of signs having meaning by convention. In this sense,language need not be confined to the spoken word.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","# Artificial Intelligence###  **What is AI?**The most frequently used word in fields of technology is ArtificialIntelligence(AI). It is as cool as it sounds and so it has always beenintriguing me. It is hard to define AI in one single sentence, but it can beconsidered as making machines intelligent. That is making machines performtasks like reasoning, problem solving, learning, planning and perception whichare basically executed by human brain.Artificial Intelligence was firstly applied just on game playing(like chess),but now its application has widened beyond our imagination. It is noweverywhere, in health care, manufacturing, education, finance, law and invarious kinds of businesses. The words(which are also closely related to AI)like Machine Learning(ML), Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Robotics areno new to most of us. But for those who are not aware, here is a shortexplanation:Â· **Machine Learning** : It is an application of AI which gives the ability tolearn and improve from experience automatically(like human brain! Though manyof us donâ€™t really â€œimproveâ€ù from experience :P).Â· **NLP** : It is the ability of machines to understand human language.Â· **Robotics** : It consists of designing and building robots which oftenperform tasks that are difficult even for humans to perform(letâ€™s just notforget Spirit and Opportunity Rovers!)Artificial Intelligence can be categorized into two parts: Weak AI and StrongAI. Weak AI is designed to do some specific tasks, and its most simple exampleis Appleâ€™s Siri. Strong AI consists of generalized human cognitive abilities.It can be used in complex situations to find out answers which may beuncertain; IBM Watson is the best example of it. While narrow AI mayoutperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess orsolving equations, Artificial General Intelligence(AGI) would outperformhumans at nearly every cognitive task.###  **Benefits** **1**. **Increase in work efficiency** : AI-powered machines can work 24X7,unlike humans. For example, AI-powered chat assistants can answer customerqueries and provide support to visitors every minute of the day. **2**. **More accurate work** : AI eliminates the compulsion of humanintervention and hence, removes all scope for human error. **3**. **Reduced cost of training and operation** : AI uses machine learningalgorithms like Deep Learning and Neural Networks to learn new things likehumans do. This way, they eliminate the need to write new code every time weneed them to learn new things. **4**. **Improved processes** : AI-powered machines can collect a largeamount of data for any particular work allowing us to gather deep insights. **5**. **Difficult exploration:** Robots can be put to use in mining andother explorations which may be dangerous for humans. For example, AI-poweredmachines can be used to explore ocean floor, hence overcoming humanlimitations. **6**. **Enhanced Automation** : AI can performs intensive human labor easilywithout the need for human intervention.###  **Risks**Well it is obvious that there are lots of benefits of AI and it has been adream for a long time for humans to create machines that have the ability totake decisions on their own. However, it is feared by some notable individualslike Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk. Here are some reasons why AI seems scary: **1\. Unemployment** : Automation will obviously eliminate human roles incertain jobs and hence lead to large scale of unemployment. **2**. **Threat to privacy** : It is possible to track and analyze our everymove online. Cameras are nearly everywhere, and facial recognition algorithmsknow who you are. **3\. Autonomous weapons** : Many countries are developing autonomous weaponsin the form of battlefield robots. If these bots are self-improving, it maylead to unintended consequences. **4\. Discrimination:** It is wonderful that machines can now collect so muchof data for specific purposes. But as they can track and analyze so much aboutus, our data can be used against us. Imagine, you are not insurable becausethe insurance company caught you many times on the camera talking on thephone.These risks cannot be neglected, but as the good outweigh the bad, stepsshould be taken to reduce the risks; like some ethical codes and policies canbe created to ensure that the risks associated with AI are reduced to theminimum.###  **Future of AI**1\. Automated transportation: Self driving vehicles will be a common thing infuture. This may help in reducing the possibilities of accidents.2\. Researchers believe that humans will be able to augment themselves withcomputers and enhance their own natural abilities. For example, brain will beable to communicate with the robotic limb to give the patient more controlover it.3\. Robots: Presently, robots do not have emotions, but in future robots maybe able to read human emotions and even produce their own; they will be goodfriends to us by helping us to stay happy. Moreover, robots will help elderlypeople for doing every day work, helping them to stay independent.4\. There may be some technology to connect the human brain with machines.Like, you just have to think of switching on the TV for actually switching iton!",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Consider - https://t.co/IS8pZu9iev: 5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Conside... https://t.co/b6MSANvt0R,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence vs Cryptocurrency: Hype and Reality - BTC Wires: Artificial Intelligence vs Cryptocurrency:... https://t.co/etxhV3wwC9,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",How Artificial Intelligence will transform modern workplace - ITProPortal: How Artificial Intelligence will transfo... https://t.co/yeXeUaVkjx,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",DWS: The opportunities artificial intelligence provides ETF investors - Artificial intelligence (AI) o https://t.co/Mzk1AdXU06 #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence and tomosynthesis for breast cancer detection - Artificial Intelligence and to https://t.co/jLn7p2NNUK #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence Seeing Massive Surge in Education - T.H.E.

While science fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-likecharacteristics, AI can encompass anything from Googleâ€™s search algorithms toIBMâ€™s Watson to autonomous weapons.[ **Artificial Intelligence**](https://wrytin.com/tanzilmahmood/anything-you-can-do-ai-can-do-better-jszx1knj) (AI) is the branch of computer sciences thatemphasizes the development of intelligence machines, thinking and working likehumans. For example, speech recognition, problem-solving, learning andplanning.Today, Artificial Intelligence is a very popular subject that is widelydiscussed in the technology and business circles. Many experts and industryanalysts argue that AI or machine learning is the future â€” but if we lookaround, we are convinced that itâ€™s not the future â€” it is the present.In the following, we are listing down 9 very intelligent AI solutions that weare using today, marketing machine learning as a present thing â€” not thefuture.### 1.SiriSiri is Appleâ€™s personal assistant for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS devicesthat uses [voicerecognition](https://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/voice-recognition)and is powered by artificial intelligence([AI](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence)). Siriâ€™s functions live primarily in the cloud, including themain automatic [speechrecognition](https://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/speech-recognition)and **N**[ **atural languageinterpretation**](https://wrytin.com/tanzilmahmood/anything-you-can-do-ai-can-do-better-jszx1knj) **.**The friendly female voice-activated assistant interacts with the user on adaily routine. She assists us to find information, get directions, sendmessages, make voice calls, open applications and add events to the calendar.Siri uses machine-learning technology in order to get smarter and capable-to-understand natural language questions and requests. It is surely one of themost iconic examples of machine learning abilities of gadgets.### TeslaNot only smartphones but automobiles are also shifting towards ArtificialIntelligence. Tesla is something you are missing if you are a car geek. Thisis one of the best automobiles available until now. The car has not only beenable to achieve many accolades but also features like self-driving, predictivecapabilities, and absolute technological innovation.If you are a technology geek and dreamt of owning a car like shown inHollywood movies, Tesla is one you need in your garage. The car is gettingsmarter day by day through over the air updates.### 3\. NetflixNetflix needs no introduction â€” it is a widely popular content-on-demandservice that uses predictive technology to offer recommendations on the basisof consumersâ€™ reaction, interests, choices, and behavior. The technologyexamines from a number of records to recommend movies based on your previousliking and reactions.It is turning more intelligent with each passing year. The only the drawbackof this technology is that small movie go unnoticed while big films grow andpropagate on the platform. But as I wrote earlier, it is still improving andlearning to be more intelligent.### 4.PandoraPandora is one of the most popular and highly demanded tech solutions thatexist. It is also called the DNA of music. Depending on 400 musicalcharacteristics, the team of expert musicians individually analyzes the song.The system is also good at recommending the track record for recommendingsongs that would never get noticed, despite peopleâ€™s liking.### 5\. Nest (Google)Nest was one of the most famous and successful artificial intelligencestartups and it was acquired by Google in 2014 for $3.2 billion. The NestLearning Thermostat uses behavioral algorithms to save energy based on yourbehavior and schedule.It employs a very intelligent machine learning process that learns thetemperature you like and programs itself in about a week. Moreover, it willautomatically turn off to save energy, if nobody is at home.In fact, it is a combination of both â€” artificial intelligence as well asBluetooth low-energy because some components of this solution will use BLEservices and solutions.### 6\. Flying DronesThe flying drones are already shipping products to customers home â€” though ona test mode. They indicate a powerful machine learning system that cantranslate the environment into a 3D model through sensors and video cameras.The sensors and cameras are able to notice the position of the drones in theroom by attaching them to the ceiling. Trajectory generation algorithm guidesthe drone on how and where to move. Using a Wi-Fi system, we can control thedrones and use them for specific purposes â€” product delivery, video-making, ornews reporting. _AI is the most powerful as well as fast developing technology all over theworld. AI one type of artificial consciousness that work is done by command ofhuman but there is no doubt of that AI do work more efficient, better andcheaply than humans and most of the business now use AI for complete theirwork._ _AI has a very bright future all over the world. in the future mostly workand field depend on_[ ** _ArtificialIntelligence_**](https://wrytin.com/tanzilmahmood/anything-you-can-do-ai-can-do-better-jszx1knj) _._#ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearnig #DeepLearning#NaturalLanguageProcessing",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","# Artificial Intelligence **â€œArtificial Intelligenceâ€ù is a word that seems to be often overused. Whatdo you think about it?**We avoid it usually, anybody who does the math usually calls it machinelearning or statistics. Itâ€™s just a public moniker which has been used fortalking about machine learning techniques and what has been happening in thelast couple of years. You can usually substitute â€œmachine learningâ€ù forâ€œartificial intelligenceâ€ù in our communication. **How would you define Artificial Intelligence?**AI is a technical system that acts with a certain degree of autonomy. Thatâ€™senough justification for using the term. **When combining robots and Artificial Intelligence, should we be afraid ofthese machines?**We probably need to be more afraid of humans, for the foreseeable time, thanwe need to be afraid of machines. The mere fact that they are getting smarterdoesnâ€™t mean they are getting more evil. There is enough evil in humansalready, so itâ€™s probably worth being more afraid of humans for a considerablewhile.The new quality is that we havenâ€™t seen this: Itâ€™s not only robots, but itsself-driving cars and many machines are also being â€œsmartenedâ€ù up now. Yourradio starts talking to you now; there is Alexa making statements while youâ€™reon the phone. All these things are new, and of course, our natural reaction isto be slightly worried. However, thereâ€™s going to be a lot more evil in humansthan in machines for a long time. **Why do you think people are afraid of machines? Why do we have thosedystopian pictures in our head of machines destroying us?**First of all, itâ€™s a pop cultural trope which is very established, and as ametaphor, it works well. Like in â€œTerminatorâ€ù, for example, there is some kindof prejudice that there are intelligent systems that are carbon-based, andthatâ€™s â€œusâ€ù, and there are the other intelligences which are silicon-based,and thatâ€™s â€œthese guysâ€ù. And Iâ€™m not so convinced.With a bit of historical perspective, what we perceive as â€œhuman,â€ù which is anormative term, isnâ€™t identical with something having an ape-shaped body orbeing Homo Sapiens. Itâ€™s something that goes beyond that. There are valuesattached that can just as well be attached to A.I. And the human is drifting.What we perceive as normal human behaviour: how we think, how we organise ourknowledge, how we interact with technology, has been continually changing forhundreds of years. Just 15 years ago, when you were supposed to knowsomething, you actually needed to learn it by heart and have it in your brain.Now we have Wikipedia and a device in our hands to look everything up. Forsomebody 200 years ago this would have been weird and super science-fiction,to us this merging of human knowledge and machine capacity for storing stufffeels completely human and normal. I believe we will see more of that processand slowly blend technology into the human further without us even noticing.And whatâ€™s good and evil, and who the good guys and the bad guys are, will bea lot less about what type of body you have, and more about: Who is this guy,what values do we share and what experiences do we share. **Do you think that something like merging machines with humans beings issomething thatâ€™s possible?**To a degree, this happened already. Us using smartphones and being connectedto all of the human knowledge is a great example. This is always there now,and this is a large part of what used to be called intelligence which we nowhave outsourced to the internet. We no longer do math in our heads; we evenhave voice interfaces for machines that do it. We used to be the only onesthat could play Chess or Go or Starcraft; now this is something that A.I. cando.Many more of these things will be outsourced, and eventually, there is ascenario where we just dissolve into a larger technological playing fieldwhere there is some human in all of it left, which is the heritage that webring to it: the way we perceive things, our poetry, I hope, will survive:things like that. Itâ€™s not necessarily my type of body. That wonâ€™t be thatterribly important. **Do you think this is a good development or is it something that we shouldstop?**Itâ€™s just something that happens, like traffic. Is traffic a good thing or abad thing? Itâ€™s a constellation of vectors and factors that interact and havebeen going on for a long time and will be going on for a long time. Weâ€™re justin the middle of it, and this is both fascinating and scary. The best thing wecan do is be very aware of whatâ€™s going on. What we should probably do is lookat these developments and say okay: how can we do good while this is going on,how can we modulate things that are important to us onto this vast, very old,super abstract and super powerful process, which you can call rationalization,or intelligence automation, or deterritorialization, thatâ€™s essentially allthe same: modernity happening to the planet, not really driven by humansâ€_potentially driven by capital â€” an abstract force that wants this to happen.And weâ€™re riding this machine.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","Never miss a story from **SFJ Business Solutions Pvt Ltd Training**, when you sign up for Medium.[Learn more](https://medium.com/@Medium/personalize-your-medium-experience-with-users-publications-tags-26a41ab1ee0c#.hx4zuv3mg)",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","No petitions, surveys, or crowdfunding",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","# _Artificial Intelligence Needs Government Regulation_ _Artificial intelligence is an aspect of technology that is constantly andrapidly evolving in todayâ€™s virtual platforms. While artificial intelligencehas a vast array of benefits for both producers and consumers, there are alsosome safety considerations that should be observed in order to execute theresources that artificial intelligence has to offer securely. Currently,producers and manufacturers have full control of artificial intelligence whileconsumers at the mercy of the programâ€™s functional purpose. Applyinggovernment regulation to protect consumers from the dangers of artificialintelligence can help to ensure that society is protected from maliciousintent utilized through artificial intelligence functionalities._ _Artificial intelligence consists of algorithms developed by programmers totarget a specific function and gather information to be utilized for anongoing purpose. One example of the use of artificial intelligence is marketresearch on a consumerâ€™s buying habits being used in an algorithm to displayappealing ads to the consumer. Artificial intelligence mines for and gathersdata from consumers or files from equipment in order to develop aninterpretation of that information that can be used for a specific purposedesignated by the programmer. (_ â€œArtificial Intelligence Historyâ€ù) _Theability for a programmer to instruct or create a set of rules for a program tofollow that will manipulate date and information in an organized manner with aspecific intent is very valuable to producers that market to consumers becauseit can motivate consumers through influence. Artificial intelligence can beused just as a television ad is used to target consumers, however it is muchmore personalized to the specific consumer seeing the advertisement because ithas gathered personal information about the buyerâ€™s spending habits._ _Consumers often times wonder why they see ads targeted specifically to theirpersonal tastes when they are scrolling through their social media platforms,or when ads pop up on their computer screen due to cookies being placed onsites they have previously visited. Many consumers are not knowledgeable abouthow artificial intelligence can manipulate the information they are absorbingfrequently. While this may not seem like a dangerous issue or threat tosociety, it is important to realize that children are seeing this informationin the same way when they utilize online platforms. Children might bebombarded with ads frequently of something that they have previously searchedfor, and sometimes that information is highly unhealthy or unethical forchildren to be absorbing. Children can have negative emotional consequencesfrom the coercion that artificial intelligence can enforce if they are seeingfearful or discriminatory advertisements._ _Government regulation can enforce rules and inflict consequences for misuseof artificial intelligence, the best strategy for keeping artificialintelligence from causing negative impacts to users is to increase awarenessamong society. Emphasizing the importance of establishing good digitalcitizenship, monitoring childrenâ€™s activity online, educating children on howto conduct online activity safely, and building a positive online environmentthat reports and monitors safety concerns is essential for protecting society.Artificial intelligence can be constructed by a programmer to carry out a veryspecific and detailed set of instructions that can be very precise andaccurate. (_ â€œA Brief History of AI.â€ù) _Importance should be placed ondevising proper rules and regulations for programmers to ensure that thesource of the artificial intelligence is reliable, secure and has goodintentions. While the consequences of misusing artificial intelligence orbeing successfully manipulated by artificial intelligence falls upon the enduser, it should still be noted that the artificial intelligence was created bya human base with a set of intentions and instructions._ _Artificial intelligence is generally resourceful and benefitting, however italso has some disadvantages and drawbacks. Benefits of artificial intelligenceinclude more personalized, targeted advertising for producers trying to reachconsumers and more appealing information for users of artificial intelligencebased on their personal interests. Artificial intelligence can be used topromote creativity and help people build businesses or promote their ideas.Artificial intelligence can also help to relieve some job functions that usedto require a lot of manual labor, such as sending out e-mails and doingresearch data on consumers. The drawbacks of artificial intelligence includethe lack of privacy involved with analyzing user preferences so closely,potential violations of privacy rights and misuse of personal information, aswell as manipulative or deceptive advertising that can negatively impact auser emotionally. (_ â€œBenefits & Risks of Artificial Intelligence.â€ù) _Government regulation can help to ensure that adult and children consumersare protected from manipulative or deceptive advertising practices that couldhave negative emotional impacts on society. Government regulation can alsohelp to ensure that producers are not using ill intentions or discriminatoryadvertising in their marketing strategies. Government regulation can enforcefairness and equality within the economy as artificial intelligence continuesto grow as a strong resource for advertising techniques. Government regulationcan also help to prevent programmers from creating algorithms that causenegative effects on the general society, such as creating artificialintelligence that harasses or discriminates against a specific audience._ _Works Cited_â€œArtificial Intelligence Historyâ€ù _SAS Institute Inc.,_ 2019\.<https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html>â€œBenefits & Risks of Artificial Intelligence.â€ù _FLI,_ 2019\.<https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/>â€œA Brief History of AI.â€ù _I2k Connect, Inc.,_ 2019\. <https://www.aaai.org/>",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","# Artificial Intelligence###  **What is AI?**The most frequently used word in fields of technology is ArtificialIntelligence(AI). It is as cool as it sounds and so it has always beenintriguing me. It is hard to define AI in one single sentence, but it can beconsidered as making machines intelligent. That is making machines performtasks like reasoning, problem solving, learning, planning and perception whichare basically executed by human brain.Artificial Intelligence was firstly applied just on game playing(like chess),but now its application has widened beyond our imagination. It is noweverywhere, in health care, manufacturing, education, finance, law and invarious kinds of businesses. The words(which are also closely related to AI)like Machine Learning(ML), Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Robotics areno new to most of us. But for those who are not aware, here is a shortexplanation:Â· **Machine Learning** : It is an application of AI which gives the ability tolearn and improve from experience automatically(like human brain! Though mostof us donâ€™t really â€œimproveâ€ù from experience :P).Â· **NLP** : It is the ability of machines to understand human language.Â· **Robotics** : It consists of designing and building robots which oftenperform tasks that are difficult even for humans to perform(letâ€™s just notforget Spirit and Opportunity Rovers!)Artificial Intelligence can be categorized into two parts: Weak AI and StrongAI. Weak AI is designed to do some specific tasks, and its most simple exampleis Appleâ€™s Siri. Strong AI consists of generalized human cognitive abilities.It can be used in complex situations to find out answers which may beuncertain; IBM Watson is the best example of it. While narrow AI mayoutperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess orsolving equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.###  **Benefits** **1\. Increase in work efficiency** : AI-powered machines can work 24X7,unlike humans. For example, AI-powered chat assistants can answer customerqueries and provide support to visitors every minute of the day. **2\. More accurate work** : As AI eliminates the compulsion of[human](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2018/11/27/want-a-bigger-bang-from-ai-embed-it-into-your-apps/#b6c0d34e2d5b) intervention and hence, removesall scope for human error. **3\. Reduced cost of training and operation** : AI uses machine learningalgorithms like Deep Learning and neural networks to learn new things likehumans do. This way they eliminate the need to write new code every time weneed them to learn new things. **4\. Improved processes** : AI-powered machines can collect a large amountof data for any particular work allowing us to gather deep insights. **5\. Difficult exploration:** Robots can be put to use in mining and otherdangerous exploration which may be dangerous for humans. For example, AI-powered machines can be used to explore ocean floor, hence overcoming humanlimitations. **6\. Enhanced Automation** : AI can performs intensive human labour easilywithout the need for human intervention.###  **Risks**Well it is obvious that there are lots of benefits of AI and it has been adream for a long time for humans to create machines that have the ability totake decisions on their own. However, it is feared by some notable individualslike Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk. Here are some reasons why AI seems scary: **1.** **Unemployment** : Automation will obviously eliminate human roles incertain jobs and hence lead to large scale of unemployment. **2.** **Threat to privacy** : It is possible to track and analyse anindividualâ€™s every move online. Cameras are nearly everywhere, and facialrecognition algorithms know who you are. **3\. Autonomous weapons** : Many countries are developing autonomous weaponsin the form of battlefield robots. If these bots are self-improving, it maylead to unintended consequences. **4.** **Discrimination:** It is wonderful that machines can now collect somuch of data for some specific purposes. But as they can track and analyse somuch about us, our data can be used against us. Imagine, you are not insurablebecause the insurance company caught you many times on the camera talking onthe phone.These risks cannot be neglected, but as the good outweigh the bad, stepsshould be taken to reduce the risks; like some ethical codes and policiesshould be created to ensure that the risks associated with AI are reduced tothe minimum.###  **Future of AI**1\. Automated transportation: Self driving vehicles will be a common thing infuture. This may help in reducing the possibilities of accidents.2\. Researchers believe that humans will be able to augment themselves withcomputers and enhance their own natural abilities. For example, brain will beable to communicate with the robotic limb to give the patient more controlover it.3\. Robots: Presently, robots do not have emotions, but in future robots maybe able to read human emotions and even produce their own; they will be goodfriends to us by helping us to stay happy. Moreover, robots will help elderlypeople for doing every day work, helping them to stay independent.4\. There may be some technology to connect the human brain with the machines.Like, you just have to think of switching on the TV for actually switching iton!",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/620/1*-7ogWsHQPxjHHI-loe7AmQ.jpeg)](https://medium.com/@arvind.patil/artificial-intelligence-2a9619f93f47?source=rss------machine_learning-5)Vepsun Training Institute conducts Artificial Intelligence training classes inBangalore at Marathahalli & BTM Centers.

Thisis a cognitive function associated with the Brain. Artificial intelligence isthe field of study that focuses on building machines that can mimic humanintelligence3 levels of artificial intelligence are1) **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)** â€” AI that specializes in one area.Google AlphaGo that beat Lee Sedol in 2016 is an example2) **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** â€” This is also known as humanlevel AI which is proficient in multiple areas. We are yet to reach this stageof evolution3) **Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)** â€” AI thinker Nick Bostrom definessuperintelligence as â€œan intellect that is much smarter than the best humanbrains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, generalwisdom and social skills.â€ù> In any evolution, the inflection points are the periods of significantchange. There are 2 inflection points in the AI evolution journey (1) ANI toAGI and (2) AGI to ASI _AGI to ASI is commonly known as the Singularity point_. Singularity refersto transformation from a finite predictable past to an infinite unpredictablefuture. Ray Kurzweil predicts that this would happen sometime in 2045. So, letus worry about that later since we got some time _Ÿ˜_.The focus here is the first inflection point from Artificial NarrowIntelligence to Artificial General Intelligence. How is this being approached?Humans use the five basic senses (touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste) toperceive the world. Can we mimic this to create Artificial GeneralIntelligence? Significant progress has been made on this frontThe sense organs for an AGI would be as follows **Eyes** â€” Cameras available in almost every device from desktops, laptops,tablets and smartphones **Ears** â€” Always on microphones which have proliferated thanks to rapidadoption of smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple HomePod **Skin** â€” The shift from type to touch based interface on devices helpscapture tactile response **Tongue** â€” The sense of taste that extends beyond just food is captured toa great extent in the digital world (content consumption, past purchases,etc.) and in the physical world through loyalty and payment cards/wallets **Nose** â€” As far as I know, the sense of smell is something which has notyet been masteredIf a company manages to find a way to pass on the sense of smell to themachine would that signify the transition to Artificial General Intelligence?Well not so fast! There is a strong debate on whether our perception basedintelligence is just a sum of the parts (in this case the 5 senses) or isthere a Consciousness that acts as a master controller of these parts. Thejury is still out on this one and I am keenly watching this space!> What does AI mean to you?This article was inspired by a book and a blogWhatâ€™s the future and why it is up to us by _Tim Oâ€™Reilly_ â€”<https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34017076-wtf>Wait but Why by _Tim Urban_ â€” <https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html>My perspective on Singularity is available here â€”<https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/singularity-sankar-s-velayudan/>#AI #Intelligence #Perception #5 Senses",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","# Artificial IntelligenceIntelligence is indeed a very, very complex word. A human being is of typeHomo sapiens which translates to â€œwise manâ€ù because our intelligence is soimportant to us. For many years, we tried to understand how we think, how weperceive, understand, and how we predict.Thinking, Perception, understanding, prediction, and action are all means forhuman cognitive behavior and itâ€™s where Artificial Intelligence comes to work.In short, Artificial Intelligence is the study of building human-levelintelligence in computer programs.In this Article Weâ€™ll cover the following:â€¢ What is Intelligence?â€¢ What is an Algorithm?â€¢ What is Artificial Intelligence?â€¢ Artificial Intelligence Applicationsâ€¢ SummaryBefore I dig into defining Artificial Intelligence, I would like to first tryto define Intelligence from my perspective. And introduce you to Algorithms. **What Is Intelligence?**There are many, many ways to define intelligence, some of those definitionsare philosophical â€“which isnâ€™t our concern in this post. While others are moreconcrete and can be used to â€“somehow measure the level of intelligence indoing a particular task.Intelligence is the ability to acquire new data from the surroundingenvironment, learn, differentiate between things, finding patterns betweenseemingly similar things that are different in reality, and finally, take anaction based on reasoning.I came up with this particular definition because it will help furtherunderstand the idea behind artificial intelligence easily. **What is an Algorithm?**Whenever I want to introduce algorithms to people, I start mentioning Macarenadance. Yes, I mean it. Let me teach you to dance Macarena.1\. Put your right arm, facing down, out in front of you.2\. Put your left arm, facing down, also out in front of you.3\. Flip over your right arm, then left.4\. Touch your left shoulder with your right arm, and your right shoulder withyour left arm.Oh, come on, sure I wonâ€™t keep going until youâ€™re a Macarena expert. But,think of a computer algorithm as those steps you were instructed whilelearning to dance, and I am your programmer, I instructed you with clearlydefined steps that would, eventually, lead you into dancing a completeMacarena.Thatâ€™s exactly what computer algorithms are. You get a problem that needs asolution. You start finding out a solution, then write it in the form ofcomputer instructions that whenever run, it would solve the problem.Always remember, an algorithm is essential for a computer to reach yourdesired output because a computer ONLY knows what you tell them. ArtificialIntelligence is a combination of smart algorithms that seems like magic. **What is Artificial Intelligence?**We talked about human cognitive abilities, and we tried to define intelligenceso that we can go further into better articulating AI.AI is simply, any technique, algorithm, or computer code that enablescomputers â€“or machines to develop and mimic human-level cognitive behavior. AIdoesnâ€™t only study human intelligence; it goes further by attempting to buildintelligent entities.AI is a very new field in science and engineering. Actually, the termâ€œArtificial Intelligenceâ€ù was coined in 1956.In the early days of the AI field, we used to build systems that would â€œSeemIntelligentâ€ù by programming virtually all possible human-like decisionprocesses. It is different now. It is impossible to write a program thatcontains every possible human decision, thatâ€™s Artificial Stupidity if we canname it. We rather now watch how human intelligence makes use of thesurrounding environment and try to come up with mathematical solutions thatcan mimic this process. **Artificial Intelligence Applications**AI applications are almost everywhere around us. Itâ€™s on your phone, car,smartwatch, and soon it is going to be in your washing machine.<https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/02/samsung-ww8800m-quickdrive-ai-washing-machine/>I picked 3 examples of day-to-day artificial intelligence we interact with. **1\. Apple Siri**Almost everyone who uses Apple products is now familiar with Appleâ€™s personalassistant, Siri. Itâ€™s the friendly voice-activated computer program that comeswith Apple iPhone as well as iPad, iPod, and other Apple products.Siri basically integrates two important subspecialties in AI which are: VoiceRecognition which is the ability of a computer to understand what you say, andNatural Language processing which is the ability of a computer to understandwhat you write. And a subfield which is: Machine Learning. Machine Learningtechnology helps Siri to get smarter and better able to predict and understandour natural language. **2\. Amazon.com**No surprise in Amazon recommending you the next thing that you would like tobuy. It might seem simple but it is a collection of AI algorithms refined anddeveloped over time to be as smart as it seems to be now.Itâ€™s quite intense to learn how likely youâ€™re into buying a particular item.Amazonâ€™s algorithms are basically machine learning algorithms that tries tomatch what you bought with people who bought similar things like you, thenrecommend to you what you might like according to your purchases and people-like-you purchases.I think Amazon is planning an AI algorithm that would allow it to shipproducts to us before we even decide to purchase it. Its imaginary but I cansee it in the horizons. **3\. Google search â€œDid you meanâ€ù**Now, youâ€™re unconsciously not worried about misspelling a word, a sentence oreven writing in a totally different language while searching google.You know it is smart enough to understand what you mean. So you hand to Googlethe job to correct your grammar, spelling, and everything. Moreover, gets youthe best result you can dream of in the first search result.Google Search is a whole lot of algorithms that are out this blog post scope.For the phrase, spelling, and grammar correction, it involves Machine Learningalgorithms that deal with Natural Language Processing.Finally, AI is a huge field that contains many subfields and technicalities.AI can now play chess, GO, prove mathematical theorems, write poetry, drive acar, and diagnose diseases.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","# AI as an enabler in IT OperationsArtificial Intelligence has been a buzzword for quite some time now. Mostexperts consider it to be one of the four pillar stones for our next step inour technological evolution:  * Artificial Intelligence  * Robotics  * Blockchain  * Quantum computingBut what is Artificial Intelligence and how does it benefit us in our dailywork as Service Managers?In general, Artificial Intelligence tries to emulate human decision makingstructures. The core foundation of AI are big data streams and machinelearning, allowing it to use algorithms to perform automated tasks, whileself-training itself. Thus, many software vendors are incorporating suchfunctionalities in their core products:  * IBM Watson  * Salesforce Einstein  * ServiceNow Automation Engine  * Microsoft Bot FrameworkThe solutions mentioned above are only a few examples. Companies are nowasking valid questions: How would a real-life scenario look like? What is themost beneficial area to fully utilize the power of AI? How mature is AI?Our answer is simple: There are various opportunities for AI and theapplication scope keeps increasing. In general, your AI solution will only beas powerful as your data and its quality. The data and its quality build thecore foundation of your AI solution. It is the nutrition of which it feeds.If you have a glance at at more traditional IT departments, you will findseveral big pools containing large chunks of data. First you will look intoyour Business Intelligence area and Data Labs. But on a second thought youmight also consider your IT Operations area. Modern IT Operations is build ontop of ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), which gives you aclear framework on how to open tickets, changes and track long lasting issues.In larger enterprises it contains millions of data entries, which can be usedto feed your Artificial Intelligence. Needless to say, that this only appliesfor ticketing tools which have a strong and global governance, which ensuresthe data quality of such entries. Given the right quality, there might beseveral business use-cases to justify the implementation of an ArtificialIntelligence.### Customer (Self-) Service AgentPutting an AI into one of your central entry points for customers or internalemployees, might provide everyone an easy way of accessing and requestinginformation, right at their fingertips. They can interact with it trough voiceor chat, establishing an easy way to access an extensive service catalogue,open an automated ticket or simply providing a first level of troubleshooting.Extensive studies have shown, that chat based AI already covers approx. 5% ofall internal customer interactions within the automotive industry. In theclick-to-chat sector, China has positioned itself as a clear pioneer, havingan adoption rate of over 25%. Being followed by the United Kingdom, Mexico andthe United States of America. Chinaâ€™s pole position among other leadingnations can be directly linked to their high mobile usage rate and itswidespread usage of chat clients, such as WeChat.### Predict outagesAnother practical use case is allowing machine learning algorithms to analyzeand scan your system and/or platform health statistics. The information aboutoutages and alerts, gives valuable insights into the overall reliability andresilience of your platform. Feeding such data into a machine learningapplication enables a pattern and trend analysis of your infrastructure.Allowing your team to recognize service interruptions and outages before theyhappen.Combining such a deployment with a Configuration Management Database (CDMB)and Change Management process can elevate your service maturity dramatically.Supporting an even more extensive risk and dependency assessment, while usinghistorical data to showcase possible impacts and improvements, beforedeploying a change.### Major Incident Manager (comms, rooms etc.)Imagine taking an Artificial Intelligence and deploying it into an role of anIncident or even Major Incident Manager. The AI would be taking over standardtasks, empowering everyone else to fully focus on the issue at hand. It wouldnot only recognize threats or outages, it would open a ticket, notifystakeholders and open a war room for the team to collaborate. During the MajorIncident Process, the AI would not only be ensuring time tracking, but wouldalso handle all documentations and also communication processes. Automaticallypreparing Stakeholder notifications and checking in with the Task Force orService Owner to validate the content, before sending it out.The AI would of course not only be connected to your ticketing and monitoringplatforms, but also to your collaboration tools, such as Slack or MicrosoftTeams. Directly engaging with the team in the channel, using the chat contentto update tickets and prepare the communication channels. The AI could alsomake predictions based on historical data and provide an analysis of changesand deployments â€” bases on earlier mentioned use-cases.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","# Artificial IntelligenceThis is an article that takes part in a whole work related with QuantumMachine Learning. If you have not checked the previous articles you can readthem here: <https://medium.com/@agus.bignu97/quantum-algorithms-2b6c9d7f80b9>As in the previous section, in this one we will introduce the second basictopic of this paper, artificial intelligence. Specifically, we will focus onone of its most worked and exploited branches by both the industry and theresearch sector: **machine learning** [1].It is a branch of computing in which a series of algorithms are applied sothat the computer â€œlearnsâ€ù about data that is introduced. The vast majority ofthis data comes in large groups, that is the reason why we call it Big Data.The algorithms this discipline handles can be of various kinds, since itdepends on the problem that one wishes to solve or attack (we will encounterthree types of learning algorithms).In turn, this field of AI relias on both statistics and probability since manylearning and decision-making techniques are based on techniques from thesedisciplines.In the field of machine learning we usually find three types of learning:**supervised, unsupervised** and **reinforcement**.#### Supervised LearningIn this type of learning, correct examples of what you want the computer tolearn are introduced to it and, with the appropriate algorithm, it must learnto find the solution on its own. Within this type of learning we finddifferent problems, specifically: **regression and classification**. We aregoing to analyze them more in detail.The first, **regression** , is used when you want to make predictions. We havetwo types of regressions: linear (a) and non-linear (b)(1)Both linear and non-linear reflect the relationship between the variables _x_and _y_. Where _x_ is the information that we introduce to the algorithm, inother words, with which it â€œtrainsâ€ù.In contrast, _y_ is the value that the algorithm returns, that is, what itpredicts. In the formulas (1) the coefficients _w_ are the â€œweightsâ€ù, theseare updated during the training to the point we want. So, we have a good modelthat describes and reproduces our data. Updating weights is the most commonform of learning within machine learning and AI. A method called _gradientdescent_ is used, which is nothing more than an optimization algorithm basedon the error that is made between the known value and the predicted value. Forreasons of space we will not go into detail. Currently, the regression isbeing used a lot in real estate and the stock market.On the other hand we have the classification. Similar to the case ofregression, we can distinguish between binary or multi-class classification.As in the regression, gradient descent is also used here to update the weightsand so that the computer can learn to recognize which class the informationbelongs to. For example, abinary classification could be to distinguishbetween cats or dogs in images. This way our classes would be â€œcatâ€ù and â€œdogâ€ùand in the training one would introduce a considerable number of correctimages to create a learning rule. Later this would allow us to recognize dogsand cats in images that the algorithm has never seen before. Not only inimages, it can also be used to recognize voice patterns, numerical data ofvarious kinds, etc.#### Unsupervised LearningUnlike supervised learning, now we do not previously know the correct answer.That is, we only have data that one introduces in the computer. So the mainobjective of this type of algorithm is looking for patterns, regularities,irregularities or other things in the data. In other words, shred and analyzethe data. This is very useful in data science where a person or a team ofpeople must analyze large amounts of data.Two major problems within unsupervised learning are the **detection ofanomalies** and **clustering**.The latter is used when we want to find relationships within the data weenter. An example could be the information a supermarket has about itscustomers and their tastes. They could get to know what kind of customers buyin their stores as a result of the best selling products. If a person wouldhave to analyze all of these he could spend days or months to reach to thesame conclusions. In contrast, a well-applied algorithm in a computer withgood computing power could do it in a matter of hours.As for the detection of anomalies, as its name suggests, it is about findingirregularities in data. That is, applying an algorithm to learn a specifictask or to detect a specific pattern and then focus on what does notrecognize, ignores or does not fit the learning rule established by thealgorithm. This helps us understand the input data. Nowadays a very usefulapplication is in the detection of frauds of all kinds.#### Reinforcement LearningThis type of learning is the one that is booming the most in the past fewyears. In some applications the result of a system is a series of actions, forexample a game. One must make decisions based on what happens in the game.That is, the information that one receives helps you make future decisions andbased on your decisions you can win or lose. So you can say that if you makegood decisions you will win the game but if you take bad you will lose. Butone can learn from bad decisions in order to avoid the same mistakes in thefuture. This example of a game is what reinforcement learning is based on.In reinforcement learning we can find four basic definitions: a **state** , an**action** , an **agent** and what could be called a **policy** taken to theexample of the game. Letâ€™s try to shed light on these definitions by returningto the example of the game. The agent would be the player. The state would bethe box in which the agent is or the moment of the game in which it is. Theaction is what the agent can do based on the information that comes to him,that is, the movement he can make, the possibilities he has, etc. Finally, thepolicy is the succession of actions carried out by the agent and the state towhich he arrives by making those decisions. The goal is to win the game, inthis case. The basis of this type of behavior are the _Markov chains_. Theyare used to make decisions motivated by a reward or punishment given to theagent by the decision made.Other applications, apart from games, in which reinforcement learning istaking part in are robotics and autonomous driving. In the first one, thistype of learning is used to make decisions and to learn different tasks. Inthe second, vehicles that drive themselves are getting better and better. Itcan be seen in companies like Tesla. This will take us to a future in which wewill not need a driverâ€™s license.#### ConclusionsIn this article we have introduced the types of learning we can face within**_machine learning._** This will help us understand the two followingarticles in which we are going to talk about four different algorithms ofmachine learning that we are going to use in the final section of this work.#### References[1] Ethem Alpaydin, _Introduction to Machine Learning, 2nd Edition_. The MITPress, 2010.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","# Artificial IntelligenceIn the first/classical paradigm of Artificial Intelligence we had classicalbinary computing systems that used algorithms to mimic logical human thinkingand machine learning. The Turing Test a.k.a. Imitation Game was designed toscore this, by measuring the systemâ€™s probability of being misidentified as ahuman subject.The end result of the classical paradigm would be for example the chatbot[Eugene Goostman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman),[Cleverbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleverbot) or the Google AI.The second paradigm of Artificial Intelligence would define AI moreholistically as:Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an autonomous, embodied, situated and self-sufficient system utilizing an enactive Bayesian cognitive brain powered byQuantum Computing (QC) and driven by the laws of the Free Energy Principle,actively and purposely engaged in the quest of achieving and embodyingArtificial Consciousness (AC).The end result of the second AI paradigm would be for example the fictionalcharacter [Lieutenant Commander Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_%28Star_Trek%29)from Star Trek.The third paradigm of Artificial Intelligence would implement emotions withthe help of more advanced QC distributed more granularly, actively andpurposely engaged in the quest of embodying/transferring Human Consciousness(HC). Having achieved this milestone, the human kind will embark in theultimate quest towards physical immortality.That is if the AI doesnâ€™t destroy humans first. That being said, it is in ournature to try anyway and to be honest thereâ€™s only one way to find out.",,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence -  https://t.co/mhAZWgaHus #ai,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",artificial intelligence on the blockchain.,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain https://t.co/0wrHy5JAbc,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence #BigData #artificialintelligence  https://t.co/X3AV4nl6PJ,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence #ArtificialIntelligence #bigdata  https://t.co/gYJteYkiPJ,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence #ArtificialIntelligence #bigdata  https://t.co/iICxKxPLd5,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence #BigData #artificialintelligence  https://t.co/k7siPAJJYE,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence",Artificial Intelligence #BigData #artificialintelligence  https://t.co/ysQCiFlAEX,,,,"_label_Artificial Intelligence","Artificial intelligence is spreading through our lives. As it moves from newfeeds to productivity tools, the boundary between what is human-made andmachine-made is becoming almost invisible, resulting in vast shifts in how weperceive and interact with the world.AI has surprised us with how it can move, see and hear, but also, with what itcan create. Once thought of as a solely human trait, creativity is now adebated topic. Can AI fully master the creative process? Or is a thoughtprocess constrained by what us humans define it as?In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo system trounced the worldâ€™s reigningchampion, Lee Sedol at Go â€“ an ancient Chinese game â€“ by using its creativeintelligence to devise a winning strategy. Although AlphaGo has been describedas years ahead of its time, AI is rapidly sweeping into our everyday lives andits advancement has begun to transform and aid creative processes, as well aschallenge what we believe to be â€˜creative thinkingâ€™.In one game against Sedol, the Google system's [37thmove](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/googles-ai-viewed-move-no-human-understand/) was one no human would think to make. ""It's not a human move.I've never seen a human play this move,"" one fellow Go champion said, beforeadding that it was ""beautiful"".Using its ability to learn human creativity from vast datasets and quicklyproduce solutions to tough problems, AI is creating a new landscape ofcreative opportunity. â€œAs humans we are very good at making sophisticateddecisions to select the best fit by taking into account convolutedconsiderations,â€ù says Daghan Cam and Michail Desyllas, Founders of Ai Build,who use AI and robotic technologies for additive manufacturing. â€œHowever, weare not very good at producing large arrays of possible solutions to choosefrom. We lose our ability to take these decisions efficiently and consistentlyas the number of possible solutions increases.â€ùAI is a solution to this issue and is enabling designers such as Cam andDesyllas to construct better designs by accelerating their thought processesand increasing their creative options. By using AI to automate the productionprocess, Ai Build reduces material usage, labour and costs whilst creatingcomplex designs that were once impossible to devise and build. In one instanceit used [concrete in irregular shaped molds](https://ai-build.com/concreteformwork.html) to reduce the amount of material needed.Creative AI is being used as more than a workmanlike tool, however. It is alsoinfluencing the music industry, giving musicians the ability to betterunderstand their creative process and even themselves. Beatboxer [ReepsOne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q981cTdL0_Y&feature=youtu.be), also knownas Harry Yeff, is the first voice artist to perform a â€˜battleâ€™ with an AIopponent. Via a deep-learning programme, a machine was programmed tocategorizes Yeffâ€™s sounds, but also create its own music.After taking part in chess tournaments and using AI to improve his game, Yeffwas initially fascinated with developing what he calls a â€˜pet selfâ€™ â€“ onewhich challenges you and leads you towards a new innovation. â€œI loved the ideaof how an opponent can interrupt you and force you to become more,â€ù Yeffexplains. â€œAI is not an â€˜otherâ€™ â€“ a hijacked sci-fi representation; it's atool, and it's something that weâ€™re already engaging with every day.â€ù AI canallow musicians such as Yeff to better understand and develop their creativeabilities and, similar to Sedolâ€™s competition with AlphaGo, raise their game.â€œIt blew my mind when they told me that in a ten minute clip of me performing,I technically made 140 fixed variations of kick drum and that's because of thesubtle human changes, which are far beyond human observation.â€ù Although AI hasenabled Yeff to further unlock his creative potential, he stresses how sciencefiction has influenced people to view AI as a separate entity and theimportance of artists in breaking down this stigma. â€œItâ€™s a responsibility ofartists like myself to go into these spaces with no agenda and try to raiseawareness and engage with it to make sure that people are seeing how thesethings can be used,â€ù Yeff explains.Although AI is giving artists increasing insight into their creative processand abilities, it also beginning to inform practitioners of the kind ofcreative output society favours. As far back as 2015, people were [confusingcomputer-generated music](https://qz.com/488701/humans-are-confusing-music-composed-by-a-computer-for-j-s-bach/) with classic pieces from the composerJ.S. Bach.Similarly to Ai Build and Yeff, visual artist Anna Ridler is using AI as atool to shape her creative strategy. In Ridlerâ€™s latest projectâ€˜[Tulips](https://vimeo.com/287645190),â€™ she took photographs of flowers andproduced an algorithm that created thousands of notional tulip varieties withunique characteristics. Although Ridlerâ€™s project illustrates the creativepossibilities of AI used in visual art, Ridler says recommendation algorithmsare changing the industry by influencing artists and curators to create workwhich society is more likely to engage with.â€œA lot of curation of art and design is now being driven by data and whatpeople seem to like,â€ù she says. â€œNetflix has probably had more of an impact onfilm making than any deep fake technology.â€ù In an auction at the end ofOctober 2018, an AI-generated portrait of a fictitious man[sold](https://www.livescience.com/63929-ai-created-painting-sells.html) forÂ£341,000.In addition to giving creatives more options, insight into their work, and theawareness of audience engagement, AI is influencing creativity by beingprogrammed to complete mundane tasks so that practitioners can focus on morecreative ones. This is widely illustrated in the gaming industry, where AIhelps automate game development tasks such as testing programs.Yet, AI used in creative practice today is self-controlled, meaning that itworks within a controlled environment and is programmed to do what itscreators tell it. â€œCreative people still want a lot of control over what AI isallowed to do,â€ù says Mike Cook, an AI researcher at Queen Mary University ofLondon and programmer of â€˜Games by Angelinaâ€™ â€” an AI that builds its owngames.â€œThat's not a bad thing, and it's still letting AI enhance our work inincredible ways, but I think the next step â€“ accepting AI into our work as acontributor â€“ it will be a huge shift in the way people create.â€ù In thefuture, Cook thinks that AI might take on a fully creative and personal rolein playing and designing games. For example, in future versions of _Minecraft_, an AI might be programmed to have an active relationship with the player andhelp them achieve their goals. DeepMind has [alreadyproved](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-starcraft-results-alphastar)it can play the infinitely complex _StarCraft_ better than humans.Cook also hopes to see AI making it easier for people to make games as well asplay them. â€œI hope that AI game designers will be able to act as teachers,mentors and collaborators for people, helping them do things they strugglewith, and giving feedback on the games they make,â€ù says Cook.As AI provides an additional and vastly diverse â€˜creative armâ€™ in a number ofindustries, it is challenging the possibilities of creation and giving us moreunderstanding of creativity. However, as its initial conditions are created byhuman intelligence, AI is still a human endeavour, and although it is startingto develop creative characteristics, its lacks the complex link betweenimagination, abstract thinking and episodic memory which scientists believemakes up creativity.Yet as human creatives are praised for their originality, many of the mostfamous artistry has been influenced and mimicked â€“ used to drive new movementsand trains of thought. As historian Yuval Noah Harari once wrote, â€œhumans areessentially a collection of biological algorithms shaped by millions of yearsof evolution,â€ù which, when thought of like this, brings us closer to AI thanwe might have thought._Reeps One is speaking at WIRED Pulse: AI at the Barbican on June 15; get moreinformation and book tickets on[wired.uk/ai-event](https://www.wired.co.uk/partnerships/wired-pulse-ai-barbican)._#### More great stories from WIRED **â€“ Why parents should[stop worrying about videogameaddiction](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/video-game-addiction-facts-statistics?utm_source=More%20Stories&utm_medium=internal)** **â€“ Why are we having less sex?[ Blamehonesty](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/uk-sex-survey-honesty?utm_source=More%20Stories&utm_medium=internal)** **â€“ Jeff Bezos wants to colonise space, but[he's destroyingEarth](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/bezos-amazon-blue-origin-moon-analysis?utm_source=More%20Stories&utm_medium=internal)** **â€“ Why staff on the[autism spectrum are a hugeasset](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/companies-employing-autistic-individuals?utm_source=More%20Stories&utm_medium=internal)** **â€“ Why Tim Cook is a[better Apple CEO than SteveJobs](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tim-cook-steve-jobs-apple-ceo?utm_source=More%20Stories&utm_medium=internal)**Get WIRED Weekender, your at-a-glance roundup of the most important,interesting and unusual stories from the past week.

The grid should be in the plane normal to the vector between the target and camera.  The width and height (in conjunction with the distance between camera and grid) of that grid will set up your FOV (the angle in x and y that your camera will see).  The number of points in rows and columns will set up your resolution.  The final step is to raycast through all the points on the grid (in order) to create an organized 2d image.  To raycast, you simply calculate the normalized vector from the camera to any given grid point and then progressively add that vector (times your search step length which is likely about the same as your search radius) to the point (moving the point towards your target) and checking if there are any points from the target cloud within some radius at each step.  If you find a target inside the radius, record that intensity into your image and move on to the next grid point.  Make sure you put a limit on how far the ray can cast (the distance between your camera and furthest target point for instance).  Although you could just use a static search radius based on your known cloud resolution of your target, you could also be fancy and make the radius scale larger, linearly correlated to distance from camera (this would be more elegant and correct to how a camera actually works).</p><p>*To clarify, drawing the grid is not actually necessary as it can all be done with applying appropriate rotations to the normal vector to get all the projection vectors.  The concept of a grid is just much easier to visualize.</p><p>One final note is that this is not real world, so you could do another thing, a parallel raycast: Much the same as before but instead of a camera point you just create the grid and then project along the grid's surface normal for all points (so they move parallel to eachother instead of spreading out pyramidally).  This does some pretty interesting things  (specifically with edges and object occlusion) and could be useful depending on what you need this image for.</p>",,,,"_label_Cloud","<p>Your question is rather broad.

Since the annotations of point cloud data is an expensiveand time-consuming process, therefore recently the utilization of simulatedenvironments and 3D LiDAR sensors for this task started to get somepopularity. With simulated sensors and environments, the process for obtainingan annotated synthetic point cloud data became much easier. However, thegenerated synthetic point cloud data are still missing the artifacts usuallyexist in point cloud data from real 3D LiDAR sensors. As a result, theperformance of the trained models on this data for perception tasks whentested on real point cloud data is degraded due to the domain shift betweensimulated and real environments. Thus, in this work, we are proposing a domainadaptation framework for bridging this gap between synthetic and real pointcloud data. Our proposed framework is based on the deep cycle-consistentgenerative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) architecture. We have evaluated theperformance of our proposed framework on the task of vehicle detection from abirdâ€™s eye view (BEV) point cloud images coming from real 3D LiDAR sensors.The framework has shown competitive results with an improvement of more than7% in average precision score over other baseline approaches when tested onreal BEV point cloud images.",,,,"_label_Cloud","<p>I want to extract data from excel workbooks which are saved in my company cloud into a excel worksheet by writing a VBA macro.

I've seen plenty if smallapps that let you do that kind of thing. But then I did some initial exploringinto Google drive. Half of the guides I read seem normal, but then the otherhalf... I'm running into Google telling me to ""enable Billing"" in theseguides. When I look at the prices, it's like $1,000+ a month for these massivestorage services. Good lord... I just wanna let my users upload some sillypictures to their personal Google drives.So all the guides are vaguely interconnected and I can't be certain what'swhat. I don't want to waste my life on guides that will tell me 20 hours downthe road that I REALLY need to give google 1000 dollars a month for somethingso basic.So, am I crazy, or what? Can a dev who's run into this question before confirmif my intended feature is possible without selling google my left kidney?

OneDrive users can now use it to simply restore files from any point in time within the last 30 days. If you accidentally delete a file youâ€™ll be able to restore it, or if you make some bad changes and want to roll back to an earlier copy.</p><p>Microsoft is marketing the Files Restore feature as a good way to protect against ransomware attacks that lock files on a local PC, and often try to delete copies that are stored in synced folders â€“ replicating those changes in the cloud. Weâ€™ve seen a number of these attacks recently, and victims have been forced to pay money to try and get their files back.</p><p>If OneDrive detects mass deletion of cloud files, Microsoft will alert users through an email or mobile / desktop notification and a recovery process will let you quickly restore to a time before the ransomware attack.</p><p><strong>OneDrive Files Restore</strong></p><p>Alongside this new Files Restore feature, Microsoft is also adding password protected sharing links for OneDrive to make it a little more secure when you share out sensitive files or folders. Outlook.com is also getting updated with email encryption for Office 365 subscribers. The email encryption can be enabled on individual messages, and Outlook.com will even prompt you to encrypt emails if it detects information like social security numbers in messages. Recipients will be able to read the messages in Outlook.com, Outlook for iOS and Android, the Windows Mail app, or just by visiting a link in the email if the level of security at the recipient doesnâ€™t meet Microsoftâ€™s encrypted connection standards.

There are many gatewaysolutions available such as [Zuul](https://github.com/Netflix/zuul),[Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/), [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-using-an-api-gateway/), etc. but in this article, we willspecifically discuss [Spring Cloud Gateway - a reactiveGateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway) built upon ProjectReactor, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Boot 2.0.First, we will start with an introduction of Spring Cloud Gateway and thendiscuss the features of it that makes it the best fit as a cloud gateway.After that, we will look into the gateway flow with different examples ofusing predicates for routing, pre-filters, global filters to modify therequest and response header and body along with[Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) support. In the end, we willcreate a simple example project to demonstrate these capabilities withdiscovery server using Netflix, multiple microservices and Spring CloudGateway routing requests to these different microservices downstream.## Blocking vs Non-Blocking GatewayA Blocking gateway such as Zuul1 requires as many threads as no of requests tohandle requests coming to an API gateway and hence a lot of resources isrequired to handle these requests. Any extra requests simply sit in the queueand wait until a working thread completes its execution. Whereas in case ofnon-blocking, the main thread is always available to serve the request andother multiple threads process those requests asynchronously in the backgroundand once the request is completely processed the response is returned. Hencenon-blocking model requires a less no of resources to serve the same amount ofrequests as compared to blocking gateway.Here is an example of [spring cloud Netflix with Zuul as GatewayProvider](https://www.devglan.com/spring-cloud/spring-netflix-zuul).Spring cloud gateway is a non-blocking reactive gateway similar to Zuul2 butspring cloud does not provide any out of the box integration with Zuul2.Here is the [performance benchmark of Spring Cloudgateway](https://github.com/spencergibb/spring-cloud-gateway-bench).## Spring Cloud Gateway ArchitectureBelow is a simple architecture diagram of Spring Cloud. In the later sections,we will discuss the different components involved in it.![spring-cloud-gateway-architecture](https://i.imgur.com/2N8AgtH.png)Once a request reaches to the gateway, the first thing gateway does is tomatch the request with each of the available route based on the predicatedefined. Once, the route has matched the request moves to web handler and thefilters will be applied to the request. There are many out of the box filtersprovided by the gateway itself to modify the request header as well as thebody. Pre-filters are applied specifically to a route whereas global filterscan be applied to all the route request. Global filters can be applied toperform authentication and authorization of all the request at one place.Once the response is generated by the downstream service, the post filter canbe used to modify the response such as to apply checksum in the responseheader to all the responses to ensure the response is not tempered due tomiddle man attack.Below is an example of a route that has a predicate defined to match all therequest URL with `/api/v1/queue/**` and apply a pre-filter to rewrite thepath. There is another filter applied to modify the request header and thenroute the request to load balanced FIRST-SERVICE.    builder.routes()                    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.rewritePath(""/api/v1/first/(?.*)"", ""/${remains}"")                                            .addRequestHeader(""X-first-Header"", ""first-service-header"")                            )                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""queue-service""))                    .build();Below is the equivalent .yaml configuration.    spring:      cloud:        gateway:          routes:          - id: first-service            uri: lb://FIRST-SERVICE            predicates:            - Path=/api/v1/first/**            filters:            - RewritePath=/api/v1/first/(?.*), /$\{remains}            - AddRequestHeader=X-first-Header, first-service-header## Handler MappingThis is the first component where all the requests hit. Handler mapping looksinto each route that is defined and tries to match with each predicate definedin the route. After the match, handler mapping routes the request to thatmatched route.In the above example, we have only defined a path predicate to match therequest. There are a couple of other predicates out of the box to define ourroute such as Host, Date/Time, Method, Headers, Query Params, Cookies, bodyetc.### Path Roue PredicateWith path predicate, we can match the request with URI path. For example,below route is matched against the URl - localhost:8080/api/v1/first/users androutes to load balanced first-service service.    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();### Host Route PredicateWith the Host route predicate, we can match Host header with any givenpattern.    .route(r -> r.host(""**.devglan.com"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();### Date/Time Route PredicateThis predicate can be used to match the route request with any givendate/time. We can use Before, After or Between to match with the date/time.    .route(r -> r.before(ZonedDateTime.now())                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();### Method Route PredicateWith this predicate, we match the HTTP request method type such as GET, POST,etc.    .route(r -> r.method(HttpMethod.POST)                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();### Header Route PredicateHeader route predicate is used to match the request with the header params.    .route(r -> r.header(""X-first-Header"", ""first-service-header"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();### Query Param Route PredicateThis route predicate is used to match the request with query parameter passedin the request URI.    .route(r -> r.query(""refer"", ""email"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();### Cookies Route PredicateThe Cookie Route Predicate Factory takes two parameters, the cookie name and aregular expression. This predicate matches cookies that have the given nameand the value matches the regular expression.    .route(r -> r.cookie(""chocolate"", ""ch.p"")                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();## Web Handler FiltersAs discussed above, we can have pre-filters, global filters and post-flters.There are many filters that are provided by the gateway out of the box and italso provides flexibility to define our custom filters that can be eitherapplied to a specific route or to all the request coming to the gateway.### Pre-FiltersPre-filters are route specific which can be used to modify all the elements ofthe incoming request such as Headers, Path, Rate Limiting, Cookies, Hystrix,Moddify Body etc.#### AddRequestHeader WebFilterThis filter is used to add extra header element in the incoming request. Ittakes a name and value parameter.    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.addRequestHeader(""X-first-Header"", ""first-service-header""))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();#### RewritePath WebFilterIt is used to rewrite the incoming request URI path. The RewritePathGatewayFilter Factory takes a path regexp parameter and a replacementparameter. This uses Java regular expressions for a flexible way to rewritethe request path. Below is the Java config.    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.rewritePath(""/api/v1/first/(?.*)"", ""/${remains}""))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();#### Rate Limiting WebFilterIt is mainly used to control the amount of incoming request to the server.Thisfilter uses a RateLimiter implementation to determine if the current requestis allowed to proceed. If it is not, a status of HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests(by default) is returned.This filter takes an optional keyResolver parameterand parameters specific to the rate limiter - replenishRate, capacity, andkeyResolverName**ReplenishRate** \- Defines number of requests per second allowed.**Capacity** \- Defines bursting capacity that is allowed. 2 consecutivebursts will result in dropped requests (HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests)**KeyResolverName** \- Custom implementation of KeyResolver interface.    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.requestRateLimiter().configure(c -> c.setRateLimiter(customRateLimiter)))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();Here, customRateLimiter is the implementation of KeyResolver interface.#### Hystrix WebFilterThe Hystrix GatewayFilter allows you to introduce circuit breakers to yourgateway routes, protecting your services from cascading failures and allowingyou to provide fallback responses in the event of downstream failures. TheHystrix GatewayFilter Factory requires a single name parameter, which is thename of the HystrixCommand.    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.hystrix(h -> h.setName(""Hystrix"").setFallbackUri(""forward:/fallback"")))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();    @RestController    @RequestMapping(""/fallback"")    public class FallbackController {        @GetMapping(""/"")        public ResponseEntity fallback(){            return ResponseEntity.ok(Arrays.asList());        }    }#### Modify Request Body FilterThis filter can be used to modify the request body before it is sentdownstream by the Gateway.    @Bean    public RouteLocator routes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {        return builder.routes()            .route(""rewrite_request_obj"", r -> r.host(""*.rewriterequestobj.org"")                .filters(f -> f.prefixPath(""/httpbin"")                    .modifyRequestBody(String.class, Hello.class, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE,                        (exchange, s) -> return Mono.just(new Hello(s.toUpperCase())))).uri(uri))            .build();    }    static class Hello {        String message;        public Hello() { }        public Hello(String message) {            this.message = message;        }        public String getMessage() {            return message;        }        public void setMessage(String message) {            this.message = message;        }    }### Global FilterGlobal filters cana be applied conditionally to all routes. The differentglobal filters are Netty Router, Web Sockets, Load Balancer, Metrics.### Post FiltersPost filters are used to add, modify, remove or rewrite response header orbody.#### Add Response Header Filter    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.addResponseHeader(""payload-size"", ""12""))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();#### Remove Response Header Filter    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")                            .filters(f -> f.removeResponseHeader(""payload-size""))                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")                            .id(""first-service""))                    .build();## ConclusionIn this article, we discussed about the spring cloud gateway and its differentcomponents such as routes, predicates, filters with example. In the nexttutorial of [Spring Cloud Gateway Example](https://www.devglan.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway-example) we will implement these theories and buildan application with microservice architecture using Spring Cloud Gateway anddemonstrate working examples on web filters to modify request and responsebody.",,,,"_label_Cloud","NASCAR Selects AWS as its Preferred Cloud Computing, Cloud Machine Learning, and Cloud Artificial ... https://t.co/jcGTumpmKr #ai #ml #dl",,,,"_label_Cloud","RT @itfmco: NASCAR Selects AWS as Its Preferred Cloud Computing, Cloud Machine Learning, and Cloud Artificial Intelligence Provider https:/...",,,,"_label_Cloud","RT @we_at_umbrella: AWS Cloud security, Cloud performance, Cloud optimization - these are the three critical elements that underline everyt...",,,,"_label_Cloud","RT @CrweWorld: NASCAR Selects AWS as Its Preferred Cloud Computing, Cloud Machine Learning, and Cloud Artificial Intelligence Provi https:/...",,,,"_label_Cloud","NASCAR Selects AWS as Its Preferred Cloud Computing, Cloud Machine Learning, and Cloud Artificial ... https://t.co/xljyo7oz20 #ai #ml #dl",,,,"_label_Cloud","@cloud_opinion Lots of options, Cirrus Cloud (highest cloud in the atmosphere, ex AWS), Cumulus Cloud (lowest cloud, ex GCP)",,,,"_label_Cloud","ffmpeg-normalize is a lib python, and i using cloud speech api with python, but i understand your doubt.",,,,"_label_Cloud",There is almost certainly an error in your Cloud Functions code.

Domainnames are stored as base64 SHA256digest sums. User has the option to delete this cache OR disable cache storagefrom Settings page\- In future versions, we will research an optional setting to AES256 encryptthis cache\- When caching is enabled, cache is compressed and written to disk once everyfour minutes to avoid multiple disk writes\-*****NOTE**:**it uses the[DNS.resolve WebExtAPI](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/ca8846835a9788a81627bdafdc960705a49435c180a470318848970b3643afd4/https%3A//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns/resolve)made available by Firefox to WebExtensions.

This is by far the easier approach, since there is no additional code needed - and thus I can't make any mistakes in it. It also means there is no additional trigger, so you're not paying for that extra invocation.</p></li><li><p>Use granular triggers to ensure my Cloud Function only gets called when it needs to actually do some work. For example, many of my functions only need to run when the document gets created, so by using an <code>onCreate</code> trigger I ensure my code only gets run once, even if it then ends up updating the newly created document.</p></li><li><p>Write the transformed data into the existing document. In that case I make sure to have the checks for whether the transformation is needed in place before I write the actual code for the transformation. I prefer to not add flag fields, but use the existing data for this check.</p><p>A recent example is where I update an amount in a document, which then needs to be fanned out to all users:</p><pre><code>exports.fanoutAmount = functions.firestore.document('users/{uid}').onWrite((change, context) =&gt; {  let old_amount = change.before &amp;&amp; change.before.data() &amp;&amp; change.before.data().amount ? change.before.data().amount : 0;  let new_amount = change.after.data().amount;  if (old_amount !== new_amount) {    // TODO: fan out to all documents in the collection  }});</code></pre></li></ol>",,,,"_label_Cloud","<blockquote>  <p>I need to make a http function that only calls one time (at launch) and after that runs every 5 minutes to check data and if that data is 2 hours old we clear it.</p></blockquote><p>For that you should use schedule functions, which are now supported under Firebase. See the blog post <a href=""https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/04/schedule-cloud-functions-firebase-cron.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scheduling Cloud Functions for Firebase (cron)</a>, which contains this very relevant example for your use-case:</p><blockquote><pre><code>export scheduledFunctionPlainEnglish =functions.pubsub.schedule('every 5 minutes').onRun((context) =&gt; {    console.log('This will be run every 5 minutes!');});</code></pre></blockquote><hr><p>The way you're now trying to implement the use-case won't work.

It is also important to understand, that Ribbon is only used as a load balancer <strong>not</strong> as an HTTP client. In other words, Ribbon's <code>ILoadBalancer</code> instance is only used to select the service instance from the server list.

You can ""chain"" Cloud Functions by creating the corresponding triggers, for example, creating a doc in Firestore in one CF (Callable Function for example), that would trigger another CF that respond to a Firestore trigger). <strong>Having said that, in most cases you can probably cover a lot of needs in a unique Cloud Function, by chaining promises, instead of chaining Cloud Functions</strong>.</p><p>Finally, I would not recommend to call an HTTP Cloud Function from within a Cloud Function because (IMHO) HTTP Cloud Functions are more designed to be called by an external consumer (I even don't know if this would work). </p><p><em>It would be interesting to have Firebasers opinion on that!</em></p>",,,,"_label_Cloud","RT @centilytics: Multi-cloud over Hybrid cloud or the other way around?
