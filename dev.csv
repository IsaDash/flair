__label__AI	"Computers which are capable of teaching themselves to predict premature death
could greatly improve preventative healthcare in the future, suggests a new
study by experts at the University of Nottingham.

The team of healthcare data scientists and doctors have developed and tested a
system of computer-based 'machine learning' algorithms to predict the risk of
early death due to chronic disease in a large middle-aged population.

They found this AI system was very accurate in its predictions and performed
better than the current standard approach to prediction developed by human
experts. The study is published by _PLOS ONE_ in a special collections edition
of ""Machine Learning in Health and Biomedicine"".

The team used health data from just over half a million people aged between 40
and 69 recruited to the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 and followed up until
2016.

Leading the work, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Data Science, Dr
Stephen Weng, said: ""Preventative healthcare is a growing priority in the
fight against serious diseases so we have been working for a number of years
to improve the accuracy of computerised health risk assessment in the general
population. Most applications focus on a single disease area but predicting
death due to several different disease outcomes is highly complex, especially
given environmental and individual factors that may affect them.

""We have taken a major step forward in this field by developing a unique and
holistic approach to predicting a person's risk of premature death by machine-
learning. This uses computers to build new risk prediction models that take
into account a wide range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lifestyle
factors for each individual assessed, even their dietary consumption of fruit,
vegetables and meat per day.

""We mapped the resulting predictions to mortality data from the cohort, using
Office of National Statistics death records, the UK cancer registry and
'hospital episodes' statistics. We found machine learned algorithms were
significantly more accurate in predicting death than the standard prediction
models developed by a human expert.""

The AI machine learning models used in the new study are known as 'random
forest' and 'deep learning'. These were pitched against the traditionally-used
'Cox regression' prediction model based on age and gender - found to be the
least accurate at predicting mortality - and also a multivariate Cox model
which worked better but tended to over-predict risk.

Professor Joe Kai, one of the clinical academics working on the project, said:
""There is currently intense interest in the potential to use 'AI' or 'machine-
learning' to better predict health outcomes. In some situations we may find it
helps, in others it may not. In this particular case, we have shown that with
careful tuning, these algorithms can usefully improve prediction.

""These techniques can be new to many in health research, and difficult to
follow. We believe that by clearly reporting these methods in a transparent
way, this could help with scientific verification and future development of
this exciting field for health care.""

This new study builds on previous work by the Nottingham team which showed
that four different AI algorithms, 'random forest', 'logistic regression',
'gradient boosting' and 'neural networks', were significantly better at
predicting cardiovascular disease than an established algorithm used in
current cardiology guidelines. This earlier study is available here.

The Nottingham researchers predict that AI will play a vital part in the
development of future tools capable of delivering personalised medicine,
tailoring risk management to individual patients. Further research requires
verifying and validating these AI algorithms in other population groups and
exploring ways to implement these systems into routine healthcare.

âWell, thatâs a really important thing to investigate.â While Naomi Wolfâs
intellectual side failed her last week, her public side did not. That first
line was her measured response when a BBC interviewer pointed out â[ on _live_
radio](https://twitter.com/thymetikon/status/1131702577878503425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1131702577878503425&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fjezebel.com%2Fajax%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1131702577878503425%26autosize%3D1)
â that cursory research had disproven a major thesis in her new book,
_Outrages: Sex, Censorship, and the Criminalization of Love_ (she
misinterpreted a Victorian legal term, âdeath recorded,â to mean execution â
the term actually meant the person was pardoned). Hearing this go down,
journalists like me theorized how we would react in similar circumstances
(defenestration) and decried the lack of fact-checkers in publishing (fact:
Authors often[ have to pay ](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/journalism-book-
fact-checking-jill-abramson.php)for their own). The mistake did, however,
ironically, offer one corrective: It turned Wolf from cerebral superhero into
mere mortal. No longer was she an otherworldly intellect who could suddenly
complete her Ph.D. â abandoned at Oxford when she was a Rhodes Scholar in the
mid-â80s, _Outrages_ is a reworking of her second, successful, attempt â while
juggling columns for outlets like _The Guardian_ , a speaking circuit, an
institute for ethical leadership, and her own site, DailyClout, not to mention
a new marriage. Something had to give, and it was the Victorians.

Once, the public intellectual had the deserved reputation of a scholarly
individual who steered the public discourse: I always think of Oscar Wilde,
the perfect dinner wit who could riff on any subject on command and always had
the presence of mind to come up with an immortal line like, âOne can survive
everything nowadays except death.â The public intellectual now has no time for
dinner. Wolf, for instance, parlayed the success of her 1991 book _The Beauty
Myth_ into an intellectual career that has spanned three decades, multiple
books, and a couple of political advisory jobs, in which time her supposed
expertise has spread far beyond third-wave feminism. She has become a symbol
of intellectual rigor that spans everything from vaginas to dictatorships â a
sort of lifestyle brand for the brain. Other thought leaders like her include
Jordan Peterson, Fareed Zakaria, and Jill Abramson. Their minds have hijacked
the public trust, each one acting as the pinnacle of intellect, an individual
example of brilliance to cut through all the dullness, before sacrificing the
very rigor that put them there in order to maintain the illusion floated by
the media, by them, even by us. The public intellectual once meant public
action, a voice from the outside shifting the inside, but then it became
personal, populated by self-serving insiders. The public intellectual thus
became an extension â rather than an indictment â of the American Dream, the
idea that one person, on their own, can achieve anything, including being the
smartest person in the room as well as the richest.

* * *

I accuse the Age of Enlightenment of being indirectly responsible for _[12
Rules for Life](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/)_. The
increasingly literate population of the 18th century was primed to live up to
the eraâs ultimate aspiration: an increasingly informed public. This was a
time of debates, public lectures, and publications and fame for the academics
behind them. Ralph Waldo Emerson, for one. In his celebrated [âThe American
Scholarâ](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/nature-addresses-
lectures/addresses/the-american-scholar/) speech from 1837, Emerson provided a
framework for an American cultural identity â distinct from Europeâs â which
was composed of a multifaceted intellect (the One Man theory). âThe scholar is
that man who must take up into himself all the ability of the time, all the
contributions of the past, all the hopes of the future,â he said. âIn yourself
slumbers the whole of Reason; it is for you to know all, it is for you to dare
all.â While Emerson argued that the intellectual was bound to action, the
âpublic intellectualâ really arrived at the end of the 19th century, when
French novelist Ãmile Zola publicly accused the French military of
antisemitism over the Dreyfus Affair in an open letter published in _LâAurore_
newspaper in 1898. With
[âJâAccuseâ¦!,â](https://www.marxists.org/archive/zola/1898/jaccuse.htm) the
social commentary Zola spread through his naturalist novels was transformed
into a direct appeal to the public: Observational wisdom became intellectual
action. âI have but one passion: to enlighten those who have been kept in the
dark, in the name of humanity which has suffered so much and is entitled to
happiness,â he wrote. âMy fiery protest is simply the cry of my very soul.â

The public intellectual thenceforth became the individual who used scholarship
for social justice. But only briefly. After the Second World War, universities
opened up to serve those who had served America, which lead to a boost in
educated citizens and a captive audience for philosophers and other scholars.
By the end of the â60s, television commanded our attention further with
learned debates on _The Dick Cavett Show_ â where autodidact James Baldwin
famously dressed down Yale philosopher Paul Weiss â and _Firing Line_ with
William F. Buckley Jr. (also famously destroyed by Baldwin), which would go on
to host academics like Camille Paglia in the â90s. But _[Culture
Trip](https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/the-extinction-of-
the-public-intellectual/)_ editor Michael Barron dates the âsplintering of
televised American intellectualismâ to a 1968 debate between Gore Vidal â âI
want to make 200 million people change their minds,â the [âwriter-heroâ once
](https://newrepublic.com/article/122680/citizen-kane-literature)said â and
Buckley, which devolved into playground insults. A decade later, the public
intellectual reached its celebrity peak, with Susan Sontag introducing the
branded brain in [_People_ magazine](https://people.com/archive/author-susan-
sontag-rallies-from-dread-illness-to-enjoy-her-first-commercial-triumph-
vol-9-no-11/) (âIâm a book junkie. â¦ I buy special editions like other women
shop for designer originals at Saks.â)

As television lost patience with Vidalâs verbose bravado, he was replaced with
more telegenic â angrier, stupider, more right-wing â white men like Bill
OâReilly, who did not clarify nuance but blustered over the issues of the day;
the public intellectual was now all public, no intellect. Which is to say, the
celebrity pushed out the scholar, but it was on its way out anyway. By the
â80s, the communal philosophical and political conversations of the post-war
era slunk back to the confines of academia, which became increasingly
professionalized, specialized, and insular, producing experts with less
general and public-facing knowledge. âAnyone who engages in public debate as a
scholar is at risk of being labelled not a serious scholar, someone who is
diverting their attention and resources away from research and publicly
seeking personal aggrandizement,â one professor told _[University
Affairs](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/endangered-
public-intellectual/)_ in 2014. âIt discourages people from participating at a
time when public issues are more complicated and ethically fraught, more
requiring of diverse voices than ever before.â Diversity rarely got past the
ivy, with the towering brilliance of trespassers like Baldwin and Zora Neale
Hurston, among other marginalized writers, limited by their circumstances.
âThe white audience does not seek out black public intellectuals to challenge
their worldview,â wrote Mychal Denzel Smith in
_[Harperâs](https://harpers.org/archive/2018/12/the-burden-of-the-black-
public-intellectual/) _ last year, âinstead they are meant to serve as tour
guides through a foreign experience that the white audience wishes to keep at
a comfortable distance.â

Speaking of white audiences â¦ hereâs where I mention the intellectual dark web
even though I would rather not. Itâs the place â online, outside the academy,
in pseudo-intellectual âfree thoughtâ mag _Quillette_ â where reactionary
âintellectualsâ flash their advanced degrees while claiming their views are
too edgy for the schools that graduated them. These are your Petersons, your
Sam Harrises, your Ben Shapiros, the white (non)thinkers, usually men, tied in
some vague way to academia, which they use to validate their anti-
intellectualism while passing their feelings off as philosophy and, worse, as
(mis)guides for the misguided. Last month, a hyped debate between psychology
professor Peterson and philosopher Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek had the former spending his
opening remarks stumbling around Marxism, having only just read The Communist
Manifesto for the first time since high school. As Andray Domise wrote in
_[Macleanâs](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/the-jordan-peterson-slavoj-zizek-
was-good-for-something/)_ , âThe good professor hadnât done his homework.â But
neither have his fans.

But itâs not just the conservative public intellectuals who are slacking off.
Earlier this year, Jill Abramson, the former executive editor of _The New York
Times_ , published _Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for
Facts_. She was the foremost mind on journalism in the Trump era for roughly
two seconds before being accused of plagiarizing parts of her book. Her
response revealed that the authorship wasnât exactly hers alone, a fact which
only came to light in order for her to blame others for her mistakes. âI did
have fact-checking, I did have assistants in research, and in some cases, the
drafting of parts of the book,â[ she told
NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/07/692409357/i-fell-short-jill-abramson-
responds-to-charges-of-plagiarism-inaccuracies). âI certainly did spend money.
But maybe it wasnât enough.â Abramsonâs explanation implied a tradition in
which, if you are smart enough to be rich enough, you can pay to uphold your
intellectual reputation, no matter how artificial it may be.

That certainly wasnât the first time a public intellectual overrepresented
their abilities. CNN host Fareed Zakaria, a specialist in foreign policy with
a Ph.D. from Harvard â a marker of intelligence that can almost stand in for
actual acumen these days â has been accused multiple times of plagiarism,
despite â[stripping
down](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/business/media/scandal-threatens-
fareed-zakarias-image-as-media-star.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1)â his extensive
workload (books, speeches, columns, tweets). Yet he continues to host his own
show and to write a column for _The Washington Post_ in the midst of a growing
number of unemployed journalists and dwindling number of outlets. Which is
part of the problem. âWhat happens in the media is the cult of personality,â
said Charles R. Eisendrath, director of the Livingston Awards and Knight-
Wallace Fellowship, in the _Times_. âAs long as itâs cheaper to brand
individual personalities than to build staff and bolster their brand, they
will do it.â Which is why Wolf, and even Abramson, are unlikely to be gone for
good.

To be honest, we want them around. Media output hasnât contracted along with
the industry, so itâs easier to follow an individual than a sprawling media
site, just like itâs easier to consult a YouTube beauty influencer than it is
to browse an entire Sephora. With public intellectuals concealing the amount
of work required of them, the pressure to live up to the myth we are all
helping to maintain only increases, since the rest of us have given up on
trying to keep pace with these superstars. They think better than we ever
could, so why should we bother? Except that, like the human beings they are,
theyâre cutting corners and making errors and no longer have room to think the
way they did when they first got noticed. It takes significant strength of
character in this economy of nonstop (and precarious) work to bow out, but Ta-
Nehisi Coates did when he stepped down last year from his columnist gig at
_The Atlantic_ , where he had worked long before he started writing books and
comics. âI became the public face of the magazine in many ways and I donât
really want to be that,â he told _[The Washington
Post](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/business/media/ta-nehisi-coates-
atlantic.html)_. âI want to be a writer. Iâm not a symbol of what _The
Atlantic_ wants to do or whatever.â

* * *

Of course a public intellectual saw this coming. In a 1968 discussion between
Norman Mailer and Marshall McLuhan on identity in the technology age (which
explains the rise in STEM-based public intellectuals), the latter said, âWhen
you give people too much information, they resort to pattern recognition.â The
individuals who have since become symbols of thought â from the right
(Christina Hoff Sommers) to the left (Roxane Gay) â are overrepresented in the
media, contravening the original definition of their role as outsiders who
spur public action against the insiders. In a capitalist system that promotes
branded individualism at the expense of collective action, the public
intellectual becomes a myth of impossible aspiration that not even it can live
up to, which is the point â to keep selling a dream that is easier to buy than
to engage in reality. But an increasingly intelligent public is gaining
ground.

The âPublic Intellectualâ entry in _[Urban
Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Public%20Intellectual)_
defines it as, âA professor who spends too much time on Twitter,â citing
Peterson as an example. Ha? The entry is by OrinKerr, who may or may not be (I
am leaning toward the former) a legal scholar who writes for the conservative
_Volokh Conspiracy_ blog. His bad joke is facetious, but not entirely
inaccurate â thereâs a shift afoot, from the traditional individual public
intellectual toward a collective model. That includes online activists and
writers like Mikki Kendall, who regularly leads
[discussions](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/xd5aq3/their-eyes-were-
watching-twitter-0000317-v21n5) about feminism and race on Twitter; Bill
McKibben, who cofounded [360.org](https://350.org/), an online community of
climate change activists; and YouTubers like Natalie Wynn, whose
[ContraPoints](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvsIonJdJ5E4EXMa65VYpA) video
essays respond to real questions from alt-right men. In both models, complex
thought does not reside solely with the individual, but engages the community.
This is a reversion to one of the early definitions of public intellectualism
by philosopher Antonio Gramsci. âThe traditional and vulgarized type of the
intellectual is given by the man of letters, the philosopher, the artist,â he
wrote in his[ Prison
Notebooks](http://marxism.halkcephesi.net/Antonio%20Gramsci/prison_notebooks/problems/intellectuals.htm)
â first published in 1971. âThe mode of being of the new intellectual can no
longer consist in eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of
feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as
constructor, organizer, âpermanent persuaderâ and not just a simple orator.â
It doesnât matter if youâre the smartest person in the room, as long as you

technology to help them speak.Credit: BJ Warnick/Alamy

In an effort to provide a voice for people who canât speak, neuroscientists
have designed a device that can transform brain signals into speech.

This technology isnât yet accurate enough for use outside the lab, although it
can synthesize whole sentences that are mostly intelligible. Its creators
described their speech-decoding device in a study1 published on 24 April in
_Nature_.

Scientists have previously used artificial intelligence to translate single
words2,3, mostly consisting of one syllable, from brain activity, says Chethan
Pandarinath, a neuroengineer at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who co-
wrote a [commentary](https://preview-
www.nature.com/platform/rh/preview/page/nature/brain-implants-that-let-you-
speak-your-mind/16645644?view=fragmentPreview) accompanying the study. âMaking
the leap from single syllables to sentences is technically quite challenging
and is one of the things that makes the current work so impressive,â he says.

## Mapping movements

Many people who have lost the ability to speak communicate using technology
that requires them to make tiny movements to control a cursor that selects
letters or words on a screen. UK physicist Stephen Hawking, who had motor-
neuron disease, was one famous example. He used a speech-generating device
activated by a muscle in his cheek, says study leader Edward Chang, a
neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco.

Because people who use such devices must type out words letter by letter,
these devices can be very slow, producing up to ten words per minute, Chang
says. Natural spoken speech averages 150 words per minute. âItâs the
efficiency of the vocal tract that allows us to do that,â he says. And so
Chang and his team decided to model the vocal system when constructing their
decoder.

record their brain signals.Credit: UCSF

The researchers worked with five people who had electrodes implanted on the
surface of their brains as part of epilepsy treatment. First, the team
recorded brain activity as the participants read hundreds of sentences aloud.
Then, Chang and his colleagues combined these recordings with data from
previous experiments that determined how movements of the tongue, lips, jaw
and larynx created sound.

The team trained a deep-learning algorithm on these data, and then
incorporated the program into their decoder. The device transforms brain
signals into estimated movements of the vocal tract, and turns these movements
into synthetic speech. People who listened to 101 synthesized sentences could
understand 70% of the words on average, Chang says.

### Two examples of a participant reading a sentence, followed by the
synthesized version of the sentence generated from their brain activity.

In another experiment, the researchers asked one participant to read sentences
aloud and then to mime the same sentences by moving their mouth without
producing sound. The sentences synthesized in this test were of lower quality
than those created from audible speech, Chang says, but the results are still
encouraging.

## Intelligible future

Speech created by mapping brain activity to movements of the vocal tract and
translating them to sound is more easily understood than that produced by
mapping brain activity directly to sound, says Stephanie RiÃ¨s, a
neuroscientist at San Diego State University in California.

But itâs unclear whether the new speech decoder would work with words that
people only think, says Amy Orsborn, a neural engineer at the University of
Washington in Seattle. âThe paper does a really good job of showing that this
works for mimed speech,â she says. âBut how would this work when someoneâs not
moving their mouth?â

Marc Slutzky, a neurologist at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois,
agrees and says that the decoderâs performance leaves room for improvement. He
notes that listeners identified the synthesized speech by selecting words from
a set of choices; as the number of choices increased, people had more trouble
understanding the words.

The study âis a really important step, but thereâs still a long way to go
before synthesized speech is easily intelligibleâ, Slutzky says.

                Apologies iâm somewhat of a new learner to programming. I have a problem that iâm trying to solve. A user has logged onto a terminal, they want to access a particular page within a cloud based software. To get into the platform of the cloud based software (before accessing the desired page above) they need to click on a link that simultaneously authenticates via AD and opens the platform page (due to the fact the have already signed onto the terminal). Then from the platform page they would navigate to the desired page. </p>

<p>The issue here is that they need to open the platform page first before they can click on a link that accesses the actual page they want to use. </p>

<p>From a user experience in certain instances, i want to bypass the platform homepage and send them straight to the relevant page (inside of this cloud based application) to streamline for efficiency purposes for a better user experience (say if clicking on a link from the work intranet that takes them to the cloud based applications desired page without having to open the platform window). </p>

<p>I hope that makes sense. Really appreciate your help here team. </p>
