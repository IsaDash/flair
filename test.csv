__label__Cloud	"<p>I have a few common approaches to Cloud Functions that transform the data:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write the transformed data to a different document than the one that triggers the Cloud Function. This is by far the easier approach, since there is no additional code needed - and thus I can't make any mistakes in it. It also means there is no additional trigger, so you're not paying for that extra invocation.</p></li>
<li><p>Use granular triggers to ensure my Cloud Function only gets called when it needs to actually do some work. For example, many of my functions only need to run when the document gets created, so by using an <code>onCreate</code> trigger I ensure my code only gets run once, even if it then ends up updating the newly created document.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the transformed data into the existing document. In that case I make sure to have the checks for whether the transformation is needed in place before I write the actual code for the transformation. I prefer to not add flag fields, but use the existing data for this check.</p>

<p>A recent example is where I update an amount in a document, which then needs to be fanned out to all users:</p>

<pre><code>exports.fanoutAmount = functions.firestore.document('users/{uid}').onWrite((change, context) =&gt; {
  let old_amount = change.before &amp;&amp; change.before.data() &amp;&amp; change.before.data().amount ? change.before.data().amount : 0;
  let new_amount = change.after.data().amount;
  if (old_amount !== new_amount) {
    // TODO: fan out to all documents in the collection
  }
});
</code></pre></li>

__label__AI	"# AI as an enabler in IT Operations

Artificial Intelligence has been a buzzword for quite some time now. Most
experts consider it to be one of the four pillar stones for our next step in
our technological evolution:

  * Artificial Intelligence
  * Robotics
  * Blockchain
  * Quantum computing

But what is Artificial Intelligence and how does it benefit us in our daily
work as Service Managers?

In general, Artificial Intelligence tries to emulate human decision making
structures. The core foundation of AI are big data streams and machine
learning, allowing it to use algorithms to perform automated tasks, while
self-training itself. Thus, many software vendors are incorporating such
functionalities in their core products:

  * IBM Watson
  * Salesforce Einstein
  * ServiceNow Automation Engine
  * Microsoft Bot Framework

The solutions mentioned above are only a few examples. Companies are now
asking valid questions: How would a real-life scenario look like? What is the
most beneficial area to fully utilize the power of AI? How mature is AI?

Our answer is simple: There are various opportunities for AI and the
application scope keeps increasing. In general, your AI solution will only be
as powerful as your data and its quality. The data and its quality build the
core foundation of your AI solution. It is the nutrition of which it feeds.

If you have a glance at at more traditional IT departments, you will find
several big pools containing large chunks of data. First you will look into
your Business Intelligence area and Data Labs. But on a second thought you
might also consider your IT Operations area. Modern IT Operations is build on
top of ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), which gives you a
clear framework on how to open tickets, changes and track long lasting issues.
In larger enterprises it contains millions of data entries, which can be used
to feed your Artificial Intelligence. Needless to say, that this only applies
for ticketing tools which have a strong and global governance, which ensures
the data quality of such entries. Given the right quality, there might be
several business use-cases to justify the implementation of an Artificial
Intelligence.

### Customer (Self-) Service Agent

Putting an AI into one of your central entry points for customers or internal
employees, might provide everyone an easy way of accessing and requesting
information, right at their fingertips. They can interact with it trough voice
or chat, establishing an easy way to access an extensive service catalogue,
open an automated ticket or simply providing a first level of troubleshooting.

Extensive studies have shown, that chat based AI already covers approx. 5% of
all internal customer interactions within the automotive industry. In the
click-to-chat sector, China has positioned itself as a clear pioneer, having
an adoption rate of over 25%. Being followed by the United Kingdom, Mexico and
the United States of America. Chinaâs pole position among other leading
nations can be directly linked to their high mobile usage rate and its
widespread usage of chat clients, such as WeChat.

### Predict outages

Another practical use case is allowing machine learning algorithms to analyze
and scan your system and/or platform health statistics. The information about
outages and alerts, gives valuable insights into the overall reliability and
resilience of your platform. Feeding such data into a machine learning
application enables a pattern and trend analysis of your infrastructure.
Allowing your team to recognize service interruptions and outages before they
happen.

Combining such a deployment with a Configuration Management Database (CDMB)
and Change Management process can elevate your service maturity dramatically.
Supporting an even more extensive risk and dependency assessment, while using
historical data to showcase possible impacts and improvements, before
deploying a change.

### Major Incident Manager (comms, rooms etc.)

Imagine taking an Artificial Intelligence and deploying it into an role of an
Incident or even Major Incident Manager. The AI would be taking over standard
tasks, empowering everyone else to fully focus on the issue at hand. It would
not only recognize threats or outages, it would open a ticket, notify
stakeholders and open a war room for the team to collaborate. During the Major
Incident Process, the AI would not only be ensuring time tracking, but would
also handle all documentations and also communication processes. Automatically
preparing Stakeholder notifications and checking in with the Task Force or
Service Owner to validate the content, before sending it out.

The AI would of course not only be connected to your ticketing and monitoring
platforms, but also to your collaboration tools, such as Slack or Microsoft
Teams. Directly engaging with the team in the channel, using the chat content
to update tickets and prepare the communication channels. The AI could also
make predictions based on historical data and provide an analysis of changes
and deployments â bases on earlier mentioned use-cases."

<p>However, if there are multiple deletes at the same time in my realtime database, my cloud function only gets triggered for one of these deletions!  What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p><em>FYI: I create multiple simultaneous database deletes by closing a browser window with multiple tabs, each tab calling <code>remove</code> on an <code>onDisconnect</code> call.</em></p>

<p>I have not so many lines of codes to change, luckily.</p>

<p>The fact is that the Storage Access Framework seems to have some issues. And it is here from Kitkat, I see (I did not know it). Otherwise my code is wrong.</p>

<p>I am not able to simply make the user choose a folder on the cloud storage so to get the Uri in return, to further populate that folder.</p>

<p>When I use the sample code found at </p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/android/storage/tree/228c8e0aa19586bfcf36318ddb191719537a45a4/ActionOpenDocumentTree#action_open_document_tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/android/storage/tree/228c8e0aa19586bfcf36318ddb191719537a45a4/ActionOpenDocumentTree#action_open_document_tree</a></p>

<p>and put it in my app, it happens that the user cannot select a cloud storage root but only disk locations.</p>

<p>[I wrote other code with some hacks that at least lead to having the cloud folder Uri back in the onActivityResult method.
Same paths:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;paths xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""&gt;
&lt;files-path name=""filesPath"" path=""/""/&gt;
&lt;external-path name=""externalPath"" path=""/""/&gt;
&lt;external-files-path name=""externalFilesPath"" path=""/""/&gt;
&lt;/paths&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It encompasses using a different intent Action but it still does not serve my purposes, the middleware doesn't like it so it breaks <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56393407/storage-access-framework-failing-to-obtain-document-tree-from-uri-returned-fr"">Storage Access Framework - failing to obtain document tree from uri (returned from Drive app)</a> ]</p>

<p>How to have the user select a folder on the cloud provider and how to get the uri?</p>

<p>For that you should use schedule functions, which are now supported under Firebase. See the blog post <a href=""https://firebase.googleblog.com/2019/04/schedule-cloud-functions-firebase-cron.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scheduling Cloud Functions for Firebase (cron)</a>, which contains this very relevant example for your use-case:</p>

<pre><code>export scheduledFunctionPlainEnglish =
functions.pubsub.schedule('every 5 minutes').onRun((context) =&gt; {
    console.log('This will be run every 5 minutes!');
});

<hr>

<p>The way you're now trying to implement the use-case won't work. Cloud Functions has a hard upper limit of 9 minutes before it kills a function instance.</p>

__label__Cloud	"<p>I would like to customize the naming strategy of the Avro schema subjects in Spring Cloud Stream Producers, Consumers and KStreams.</p>

<p>This would be done in Kafka with the properties <code>key.subject.name.strategy</code> and <code>value.subject.name.strategy</code> -> <a href=""https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/serializer-formatter.html#subject-name-strategy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.confluent.io/current/schema-registry/serializer-formatter.html#subject-name-strategy</a></p>

<p>In a native Kafka Producer this works:</p>

<pre><code>
private val producer: KafkaProducer&lt;Int, Customer&gt;

    init {
        val props = Properties()
        ...
        props[AbstractKafkaAvroSerDeConfig.SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL_CONFIG] = ""http://localhost:8081""
        props[AbstractKafkaAvroSerDeConfig.VALUE_SUBJECT_NAME_STRATEGY] = TopicRecordNameStrategy::class.java.name
        producer = KafkaProducer(props)
    }

    fun sendCustomerEvent(customer: Customer) {
        val record: ProducerRecord&lt;Int, Customer&gt; = ProducerRecord(""customer"", customer.id, customer)
        producer.send(record)
    }
</code></pre>

<p>However I cannot find how to do this in Spring Cloud Stream. So far I have tried this in a producer:</p>

<pre><code>spring:
  application:
    name: spring-boot-customer-service
  cloud:
    stream:
      kafka:
        bindings:
          output:
            producer:
              configuration:
                key:
                  serializer: org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.IntegerSerializer
                value:
                  subject:
                    name:
                      strategy: io.confluent.kafka.serializers.subject.TopicRecordNameStrategy
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently Spring Cloud uses it's own subject naming strategy with the interface <code>org.springframework.cloud.stream.schema.avro.SubjectNamingStrategy</code> and only one subclass: <code>DefaultSubjectNamingStrategy</code>.</p>

<p>Is there declarative way of configuring <code>value.subject.name.strategy</code> or are we expected to provide our own <code>org.springframework.cloud.stream.schema.avro.SubjectNamingStrategy</code> implementation and the property <code>spring.cloud.stream.schema.avro.subject-naming-strategy</code>?</p>

 **Sales Cloud**

* âSales Cloudâ refers to the âsalesâ module in [Salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com/)
* It includes Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Contracts, Opportunities, Products, Price books, Quotes, and Campaigns (limits apply).
* It includes features such as Web-to-lead to support online lead capture, with auto-response rules.
* It is designed to be a start-to-end setup for the entire sales process; you use this to help generate revenue.

 **Service Cloud**

*âService Cloudâ refers to the âserviceâ (as in âcustomer serviceâ) module in [Salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com/).
* It includes Accounts, Contacts, Cases, and Solutions.
* It also encompasses features such as the Public Knowledge Base, Web-to-case, Call Center, and the Self-Service Portal, as well as customer service automation (e.g. escalation rules, assignment rules).
* It is designed to allow you to support past, current, and future clientsâ requests for assistance with a product, service, billing, etc; you use this to help make people happy.
* The differences between Sales Cloud and Service Cloud are the same across each âeditionâ (âprofessionalâ, âenterpriseâ and âunlimitedâ), mainly outlined above.
* The differences, as you can gather from the prior paragraphs, is that each cloud is designed to support a specific set of features that you would use to sell services and products, and support those services and products (respectively).

The main differences you will find are the limits between each edition.
Professional Edition provides basic functionality; you can create limited
customized UI pages (Visualforce), and you can use standard automation (e.g.
assignment, escalation, and auto-response rules).
Enterprise Edition provides additional features, including custom automation
(e.g. workflow rules, Apex Code), improved Visualforce functionality,
integration (API) access, generally increased limits, and additional
customization features (e.g. more fields per object). Unlimited Edition is an
extension of Enterprise Edition and includes more storage space, premier
support, more objects, increased API limits, and so on.

__label__AI	"Milan, March 14, 2019 - A group at Politecnico di Milano has developed an
electronic circuit able to solve a system of linear equations in a single
operation in the timescale of few tens of ns. The performance of this new
circuit is superior not only to the classical digital computers, but also to
the futuristic quantum computers: it will be soon possible to develop a new
generation of computing accelerators that will revolutionize the technology of
artificial intelligence.

Solving a system of linear equations means finding the unknown vector x which
satisfies the equation Ax = b, where A is a matrix of coefficients and b is a
known vector. To solve this problem, a conventional digital computer executes
an algorithm which takes several operations, thus translating into
considerable time and energy consumption.

The new circuit, which has been developed in the frame of the ERC European
project RESCUE (Resistive switch computing beyond CMOS), solves systems of
linear equations (Ax=b) thanks to an innovative method of in-memory computing,
where the coefficients of matrix A are stored in a special device called
memristor. The memristor is able to store analogue values, thus a memristor
matrix can physically map a coefficient matrix A within the circuit, thus
strongly accelerating the computation.

The memristor array has been developed at the Clean Room of the Center for
micro and nano fabrication Polifab of Politecnico di Milano. The memristor
circuit has been tested and validated on a wide set of algebraic problems,
such as the ranking of internet websites and the solution of complicated
differential equations, such as the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the computation
of the quantum wavefunction for an electron. All these problems are solved in
a single operation.

These results have been published on the prestigious journal PNAS of the
National Academy of Science of the USA. (See the link:

__label__AI	"Computers which are capable of teaching themselves to predict premature death
could greatly improve preventative healthcare in the future, suggests a new
study by experts at the University of Nottingham.

The team of healthcare data scientists and doctors have developed and tested a
system of computer-based 'machine learning' algorithms to predict the risk of
early death due to chronic disease in a large middle-aged population.

They found this AI system was very accurate in its predictions and performed
better than the current standard approach to prediction developed by human
experts. The study is published by _PLOS ONE_ in a special collections edition
of ""Machine Learning in Health and Biomedicine.""

The team used health data from just over half a million people aged between 40
and 69 recruited to the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 and followed up until
2016.

Leading the work, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Data Science, Dr
Stephen Weng, said: ""Preventative healthcare is a growing priority in the
fight against serious diseases so we have been working for a number of years
to improve the accuracy of computerised health risk assessment in the general
population. Most applications focus on a single disease area but predicting
death due to several different disease outcomes is highly complex, especially
given environmental and individual factors that may affect them.

""We have taken a major step forward in this field by developing a unique and
holistic approach to predicting a person's risk of premature death by machine-
learning. This uses computers to build new risk prediction models that take
into account a wide range of demographic, biometric, clinical and lifestyle
factors for each individual assessed, even their dietary consumption of fruit,
vegetables and meat per day.

""We mapped the resulting predictions to mortality data from the cohort, using
Office of National Statistics death records, the UK cancer registry and
'hospital episodes' statistics. We found machine learned algorithms were
significantly more accurate in predicting death than the standard prediction
models developed by a human expert.""

The AI machine learning models used in the new study are known as 'random
forest' and 'deep learning'. These were pitched against the traditionally-used
'Cox regression' prediction model based on age and gender -- found to be the
least accurate at predicting mortality -- and also a multivariate Cox model
which worked better but tended to over-predict risk.

Professor Joe Kai, one of the clinical academics working on the project, said:
""There is currently intense interest in the potential to use 'AI' or 'machine-
learning' to better predict health outcomes. In some situations we may find it
helps, in others it may not. In this particular case, we have shown that with
careful tuning, these algorithms can usefully improve prediction.

""These techniques can be new to many in health research, and difficult to
follow. We believe that by clearly reporting these methods in a transparent
way, this could help with scientific verification and future development of
this exciting field for health care.""

This new study builds on previous work by the Nottingham team which showed
that four different AI algorithms, 'random forest', 'logistic regression',
'gradient boosting' and 'neural networks', were significantly better at
predicting cardiovascular disease than an established algorithm used in
current cardiology guidelines. This earlier study is available here.

The Nottingham researchers predict that AI will play a vital part in the
development of future tools capable of delivering personalised medicine,
tailoring risk management to individual patients. Further research requires
verifying and validating these AI algorithms in other population groups and
exploring ways to implement these systems into routine healthcare.
