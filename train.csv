__label__Cloud	I do not think the second part of your answer is possible with Cloud Run. Although Cloud Run is running a container, it is not a Docker container platform. The listening port (one port) for the entire container is controlled by Google. No access to Docker networks by name, etc. The address of another container would be unknown. How many containers are running at the same time is unknown (at this time). Cloud Run is designed as an HTTP Request / Response system that scales based upon requests per second.

__label__Cloud	"<p>There are two kinds of cloud Functions for Firebase: the ones that you can <strong>call directly</strong> (<a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTTPS Callable functions</a>, <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/http-events"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HTTPS ""simple"" functions</a> and <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/schedule-functions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scheduled functions</a>) and the one that <strong>respond to events</strong> generated by some of the Firebase services or Google Cloud features like for exampel  <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/firestore-events"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Firestore</a>, <code>https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/gcp-storage-events</code> or <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/gcp-storage-events"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cloud Storage</a> (see <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions</a> for a full list)</p>

<p>Classically when you want to send a response to a user after he/she initiated a Cloud Function, you would choose an HTTPS Callable functions or an HTTPS ""simple"" functions. But this is not the only way to do it: you can very well send a feedback to the user with a background triggered Cloud Function, mainly by writing something in Firestore or the Realtime database to a location the front-end is listening to.</p>

<p>With this second way, you can very well ""respond to the user, <strong>then continue</strong> on with [the] cloud function"". While with a callable Cloud Function when you send back the response to the user the Function is terminated.</p>

<p>So let's describe this method in a bit more details for Firestore:</p>

<ol>
<li>You trigger the background function, for example by writing to a Firestore document/collection from your front-end</li>
<li>At the same time, from the front-end, you set a listener to a specific document (<a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/listen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/listen</a>)</li>
<li>The Cloud Function starts to do some work and at one moment write to this specific document in Firestore</li>
<li>In the front-end, the user is informed of the write through the listener</li>
<li>In the background the Cloud Function can continue its other tasks.</li>
</ol>

<p>The key point is that you have to correctly chain all the asynchronous tasks of the Cloud Function by chaining the promises.</p>

__label__Cloud	"<p>Ok, I'll answer this question myself, in case someone else may need that in the future.<br>
Actually, I managed to implement it finally - even though the help from the creators of all of this was rather disappointing.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong> - the solution is here: <a href=""https://github.com/TheFonz2017/Spring-Cloud-Netflix-Ribbon-CF-Routing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/TheFonz2017/Spring-Cloud-Netflix-Ribbon-CF-Routing</a></p>

<p>The solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allows to use Ribbon on Cloud Foundry, overriding the Go-Router's load balancing.</li>
<li>Adds a custom routing header to Ribbon load balancing requests (including retries) to instruct CF's Go-Router to route requests to service instance selected by Ribbon (rather than its own).</li>
<li>Shows how to intercept load balancing requests</li>
</ul>

<p>The key to understanding this is that Spring Cloud has its own LoadBalancer framework, for which Ribbon is just one possible implementation. It is also important to understand, that Ribbon is only used as a load balancer <strong>not</strong> as an HTTP client. In other words, Ribbon's <code>ILoadBalancer</code> instance is only used to select the service instance from the server list. Requests to the server instances is done by an implementation Spring Cloud's <code>AbstractLoadBalancingClient</code>. For Ribbon, these are sub-classes of <code>RibbonLoadBalancingHttpClient</code> and <code>RetryableRibbonLoadBalancingHttpClient</code>. </p>

<p>So the initial approach to adding an HTTP header to the requests sent by Ribbon's HTTP client did not succeed, since Ribbon's HTTP / Rest client is actually not being used by Spring Cloud.</p>

<p>The solution is to implement a Spring Cloud <code>LoadBalancerRequestTransformer</code> which (contrary to its name) is a request interceptor. </p>

<p>My solution uses the following implementation: </p>

<pre><code>public class CFLoadBalancerRequestTransformer implements LoadBalancerRequestTransformer {
    public static final String CF_APP_GUID = ""cfAppGuid"";
    public static final String CF_INSTANCE_INDEX = ""cfInstanceIndex"";
    public static final String ROUTING_HEADER = ""X-CF-APP-INSTANCE"";

    @Override
    public HttpRequest transformRequest(HttpRequest request, ServiceInstance instance) {

        System.out.println(""Transforming Request from LoadBalancer Ribbon)."");

        // First: Get the service instance information from the lower Ribbon layer.
        //        This will include the actual service instance information as returned by Eureka.
        RibbonLoadBalancerClient.RibbonServer serviceInstanceFromRibbonLoadBalancer = (RibbonLoadBalancerClient.RibbonServer) instance;

        // Second: Get the the service instance from Eureka, which is encapsulated inside the Ribbon service instance wrapper.
        DiscoveryEnabledServer serviceInstanceFromEurekaClient = (DiscoveryEnabledServer) serviceInstanceFromRibbonLoadBalancer.getServer();

        // Finally: Get access to all the cool information that Eureka provides about the service instance (including metadata and much more).
        //          All of this is available for transforming the request now, if necessary.
        InstanceInfo instanceInfo = serviceInstanceFromEurekaClient.getInstanceInfo();

        // If it's only the instance metadata you are interested in, you can also get it without explicitly down-casting as shown above.
        Map&lt;String, String&gt; metadata = instance.getMetadata();
        System.out.println(""Instance: "" + instance);

        dumpServiceInstanceInformation(metadata, instanceInfo);

        if (metadata.containsKey(CF_APP_GUID) &amp;&amp; metadata.containsKey(CF_INSTANCE_INDEX)) {
            final String headerValue = String.format(""%s:%s"", metadata.get(CF_APP_GUID), metadata.get(CF_INSTANCE_INDEX));

            System.out.println(""Returning Request with Special Routing Header"");
            System.out.println(""Header Value: "" + headerValue);

            // request.getHeaders might be immutable, so we return a wrapper that pretends to be the original request.
            // and that injects an extra header.
            return new CFLoadBalancerHttpRequestWrapper(request, headerValue);
        }

        return request;
    }

    /**
     * Dumps metadata and InstanceInfo as JSON objects on the console.
     * @param metadata the metadata (directly) retrieved from 'ServiceInstance'

     */
    private void dumpServiceInstanceInformation(Map&lt;String, String&gt; metadata, InstanceInfo instanceInfo) {
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        String json;
        try {
            json = mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(metadata);
            System.err.println(""-- Metadata: "" );
            System.err.println(json);

            json = mapper.writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(instanceInfo);
            System.err.println(""-- InstanceInfo: "" );
            System.err.println(json);
        } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
            System.err.println(e);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Wrapper class for an HttpRequest which may only return an
     * immutable list of headers. The wrapper immitates the original
     * request and will return the original headers including a custom one
     * added when getHeaders() is called.
     */
    private class CFLoadBalancerHttpRequestWrapper implements HttpRequest {

        private HttpRequest request;
        private String headerValue;

        CFLoadBalancerHttpRequestWrapper(HttpRequest request, String headerValue) {
            this.request = request;
            this.headerValue = headerValue;
        }

        @Override
        public HttpHeaders getHeaders() {
            HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
            headers.putAll(request.getHeaders());
            headers.add(ROUTING_HEADER, headerValue);
            return headers;
        }

        @Override
        public String getMethodValue() {
            return request.getMethodValue();
        }

        @Override
        public URI getURI() {
            return request.getURI();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The class is looking for the information required for setting the CF routing header in the service instance metadata returned by Eureka.</p>

<p>That information is </p>

<ul>
<li>The GUID of the CF application that implements the service and of which several instances exist for load balancing.</li>
<li>The index of the service / application instance that the request should be routed to.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to provide that in the <code>application.yml</code> of your service like so:</p>

<pre><code>eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: ${vcap.application.uris[0]:localhost}
    metadata-map:
      # Adding information about the application GUID and app instance index to
      # each instance metadata. This will be used for setting the X-CF-APP-INSTANCE header
      # to instruct Go-Router where to route.
      cfAppGuid:       ${vcap.application.application_id}
      cfInstanceIndex: ${INSTANCE_INDEX}

  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: https://eureka-server.&lt;your cf domain&gt;/eureka
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, you need to register the <code>LoadBalancerRequestTransformer</code> implementation in your Spring configuration: </p>

<pre><code>@Bean
public LoadBalancerRequestTransformer customRequestTransformer() {
  return new CFLoadBalancerRequestTransformer();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this was tested for <code>@LoadBalanced RestTemplate</code>'s but should work similarly for <code>@FeignClient</code>s.</p>

Computers have become so smart during the past 20 years that people don't
think twice about chatting with digital assistants like Alexa and Siri or
seeing their friends automatically tagged in Facebook pictures.

But making those quantum leaps from [science
fiction](https://techxplore.com/tags/science+fiction/) to reality required
hard work from computer scientists like Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and
Yann LeCun. The trio tapped into their own brainpower to make it possible for
machines to learn like humans, a breakthrough now commonly known as
""[artificial
intelligence](https://techxplore.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/),"" or AI.

Their insights and persistence were rewarded Wednesday with the Turing Award,
an honor that has become known as [technology
industry](https://techxplore.com/tags/technology+industry/)'s version of the
Nobel Prize. It comes with a $1 million prize funded by Google, a company
where AI has become part of its DNA.

The award marks the latest recognition of the instrumental role that
artificial intelligence will likely play in redefining the relationship
between humanity and technology in the decades ahead.

""Artificial intelligence is now one of the fastest-growing areas in all of
science and one of the most talked-about topics in society,"" said Cherri
Pancake, president of the Association for Computing Machinery, the group
behind the Turing Award.

Although they have known each other for than 30 years, Bengio, Hinton and
LeCun have mostly worked separately on technology known as neural networks.
These are the electronic engines that power tasks such as facial and speech
recognition, areas where computers have made enormous strides over the past
decade. Such neural networks also are a critical component of robotic systems
that are automating a wide range of other human activity, including driving.

Their belief in the power of [neural
networks](https://techxplore.com/tags/neural+networks/) was once mocked by
their peers, Hinton said. No more. He now works at Google as a vice president
and senior fellow while LeCun is chief AI scientist at Facebook. Bengio
remains immersed in academia as a University of Montreal professor in addition
to serving as scientific director at the Artificial Intelligence Institute in
Quebec.

""For a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was
nonsense,"" Hinton said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""They
thought we were very misguided and what we were doing was a very surprising
thing for apparently intelligent people to waste their time on. My message to
young researchers is, don't be put off if everyone tells you what are doing is
silly.""

Now, some people are worried that the results of the researchers' efforts
might spiral out of control.

While the AI revolution is raising hopes that computers will make most
people's lives more convenient and enjoyable, it's also stoking fears that
humanity eventually will be living at the mercy of machines.

Bengio, Hinton and LeCun share some of those concernsâespecially the doomsday
scenarios that envision AI technology developed into weapons systems that wipe
out humanity.

But they are far more optimistic about the other prospects of AIâempowering
computers to deliver more accurate warnings about floods and earthquakes, for
instance, or detecting health risks, such as cancer and heart attacks, far
earlier than human doctors.

""One thing is very clear, the techniques that we developed can be used for an
enormous amount of good affecting hundreds of millions of people,"" Hinton
said.

<blockquote>
  <p>Cloud Bigtable also supports some write operations that would require
  a transaction in other databases:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>Read-modify-write operations, including increments and appends. A
  read-modify-write operation reads an existing value; increments or
  appends to the existing value; and writes the updated value to the
  table. </p></li>
  <li><p>Check-and-mutate operations, also known as conditional
  mutations or conditional writes. In a check-and-mutate operation,
  Cloud Bigtable checks a row to see if it meets a specified condition.
  If the condition is met, Cloud Bigtable writes new values to the row.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if I understand correctly, if I need to use ""Read-modify-write"" operations or ""Check-and-mutate"" operations, I need to enable single-row transactions.</p>

<p>Those operations are API methods like <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/data/rpc/google.bigtable.v2#google.bigtable.v2.Bigtable.CheckAndMutateRow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CheckAndMutateRow</a>, right?
So what if a program uses that method and single-row transactions is not enabled? Will the app fail? Am on the right direction?</p>

<p>Basically, I am looking to understand how, when and where (in an app) the single-row transaction setting on the app profile is being used.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

__label__AI	"Artificial intelligence is spreading through our lives. As it moves from new
feeds to productivity tools, the boundary between what is human-made and
machine-made is becoming almost invisible, resulting in vast shifts in how we
perceive and interact with the world.

AI has surprised us with how it can move, see and hear, but also, with what it
can create. Once thought of as a solely human trait, creativity is now a
debated topic. Can AI fully master the creative process? Or is a thought
process constrained by what us humans define it as?

In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo system trounced the worldâs reigning
champion, Lee Sedol at Go â an ancient Chinese game â by using its creative
intelligence to devise a winning strategy. Although AlphaGo has been described
as years ahead of its time, AI is rapidly sweeping into our everyday lives and
its advancement has begun to transform and aid creative processes, as well as
challenge what we believe to be âcreative thinkingâ.

In one game against Sedol, the Google system's [37th
move](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/googles-ai-viewed-move-no-human-
understand/) was one no human would think to make. ""It's not a human move.
I've never seen a human play this move,"" one fellow Go champion said, before
adding that it was ""beautiful"".

Using its ability to learn human creativity from vast datasets and quickly
produce solutions to tough problems, AI is creating a new landscape of
creative opportunity. âAs humans we are very good at making sophisticated
decisions to select the best fit by taking into account convoluted
considerations,â says Daghan Cam and Michail Desyllas, Founders of Ai Build,
who use AI and robotic technologies for additive manufacturing. âHowever, we
are not very good at producing large arrays of possible solutions to choose
from. We lose our ability to take these decisions efficiently and consistently
as the number of possible solutions increases.â

AI is a solution to this issue and is enabling designers such as Cam and
Desyllas to construct better designs by accelerating their thought processes
and increasing their creative options. By using AI to automate the production
process, Ai Build reduces material usage, labour and costs whilst creating
complex designs that were once impossible to devise and build. In one instance
it used [concrete in irregular shaped molds](https://ai-
build.com/concreteformwork.html) to reduce the amount of material needed.

Creative AI is being used as more than a workmanlike tool, however. It is also
influencing the music industry, giving musicians the ability to better
understand their creative process and even themselves. Beatboxer [Reeps
One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q981cTdL0_Y&feature=youtu.be), also known
as Harry Yeff, is the first voice artist to perform a âbattleâ with an AI
opponent. Via a deep-learning programme, a machine was programmed to
categorizes Yeffâs sounds, but also create its own music.

After taking part in chess tournaments and using AI to improve his game, Yeff
was initially fascinated with developing what he calls a âpet selfâ â one
which challenges you and leads you towards a new innovation. âI loved the idea
of how an opponent can interrupt you and force you to become more,â Yeff
explains. âAI is not an âotherâ â a hijacked sci-fi representation; it's a
tool, and it's something that weâre already engaging with every day.â AI can
allow musicians such as Yeff to better understand and develop their creative
abilities and, similar to Sedolâs competition with AlphaGo, raise their game.

âIt blew my mind when they told me that in a ten minute clip of me performing,
I technically made 140 fixed variations of kick drum and that's because of the
subtle human changes, which are far beyond human observation.â Although AI has
enabled Yeff to further unlock his creative potential, he stresses how science
fiction has influenced people to view AI as a separate entity and the
importance of artists in breaking down this stigma. âItâs a responsibility of
artists like myself to go into these spaces with no agenda and try to raise
awareness and engage with it to make sure that people are seeing how these
things can be used,â Yeff explains.

Although AI is giving artists increasing insight into their creative process
and abilities, it also beginning to inform practitioners of the kind of
creative output society favours. As far back as 2015, people were [confusing
computer-generated music](https://qz.com/488701/humans-are-confusing-music-
composed-by-a-computer-for-j-s-bach/) with classic pieces from the composer
J.S. Bach.

Similarly to Ai Build and Yeff, visual artist Anna Ridler is using AI as a
tool to shape her creative strategy. In Ridlerâs latest project
â[Tulips](https://vimeo.com/287645190),â she took photographs of flowers and
produced an algorithm that created thousands of notional tulip varieties with
unique characteristics. Although Ridlerâs project illustrates the creative
possibilities of AI used in visual art, Ridler says recommendation algorithms
are changing the industry by influencing artists and curators to create work
which society is more likely to engage with.

âA lot of curation of art and design is now being driven by data and what
people seem to like,â she says. âNetflix has probably had more of an impact on
film making than any deep fake technology.â In an auction at the end of
October 2018, an AI-generated portrait of a fictitious man
[sold](https://www.livescience.com/63929-ai-created-painting-sells.html) for
Â£341,000.

In addition to giving creatives more options, insight into their work, and the
awareness of audience engagement, AI is influencing creativity by being
programmed to complete mundane tasks so that practitioners can focus on more
creative ones. This is widely illustrated in the gaming industry, where AI
helps automate game development tasks such as testing programs.

Yet, AI used in creative practice today is self-controlled, meaning that it
works within a controlled environment and is programmed to do what its
creators tell it. âCreative people still want a lot of control over what AI is
allowed to do,â says Mike Cook, an AI researcher at Queen Mary University of
London and programmer of âGames by Angelinaâ â an AI that builds its own
games.

âThat's not a bad thing, and it's still letting AI enhance our work in
incredible ways, but I think the next step â accepting AI into our work as a
contributor â it will be a huge shift in the way people create.â In the
future, Cook thinks that AI might take on a fully creative and personal role
in playing and designing games. For example, in future versions of _Minecraft_
, an AI might be programmed to have an active relationship with the player and
help them achieve their goals. DeepMind has [already
proved](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-starcraft-results-alphastar)
it can play the infinitely complex _StarCraft_ better than humans.

Cook also hopes to see AI making it easier for people to make games as well as
play them. âI hope that AI game designers will be able to act as teachers,
mentors and collaborators for people, helping them do things they struggle
with, and giving feedback on the games they make,â says Cook.

As AI provides an additional and vastly diverse âcreative armâ in a number of
industries, it is challenging the possibilities of creation and giving us more
understanding of creativity. However, as its initial conditions are created by
human intelligence, AI is still a human endeavour, and although it is starting
to develop creative characteristics, its lacks the complex link between
imagination, abstract thinking and episodic memory which scientists believe
makes up creativity.

Yet as human creatives are praised for their originality, many of the most
famous artistry has been influenced and mimicked â used to drive new movements
and trains of thought. As historian Yuval Noah Harari once wrote, âhumans are
essentially a collection of biological algorithms shaped by millions of years
of evolution,â which, when thought of like this, brings us closer to AI than
we might have thought.

__label__Cloud	"<p>I am using Cloud Functions to handle read/write to Cloud Firestore on the server side. The Cloud Functions are triggered by clients in the web app using HTTPS callable function.</p>

<p>When calling a Cloud Functions using HTTPS, there is a parameter sent from the client call ""context"" that carries user auth information. For example, a Cloud Functions on the server can look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Saves a message to the Firebase Realtime Database but sanitizes the text by removing swearwords.
exports.addMessage = functions.https.onCall((data, context) =&gt; {
  // ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, since <code>context</code> is passed by the client, and the client could pass in a manipulated ID token, do I need to always perform a ID token verification before trusting and using something like <code>context.auth.uid</code> to interact with my database?</p>

<p>The ID token verification I am talking about is this:</p>

<pre><code>// idToken comes from the client app
admin.auth().verifyIdToken(idToken)
  .then(function(decodedToken) {
    var uid = decodedToken.uid;
    // ...
  }).catch(function(error) {
    // Handle error
  });
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, I want to know if Firebase performs ID token verification automatically when passing <code>context</code> using https call and therefore I can go ahead and trust that if the client has manipulated <code>context</code>, the https call will fail due to token verification failing. Or, do I need to explicitly do a manual ID token verification on the server every single time to check the integrity of <code>context</code>, since the client can easily insert a manipulated token using the browser's devtools or something like that.</p>

of Artificial Intelligence, nor will you be able to even apply it very well.
These books will cover topics like Neural Networks, Mathematical
Optimizations, Logic, Probability, and Economics â which are all _extremely_
useful in todayâs modern world.

### 1\. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach

[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
Approach](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9332543518/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zeroequalsfal-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=9332543518&linkId=d01c6c70480b5bb97712ea8d4f488ded)
provides AI algorithm techniques in-detail, from pathfinding to intelligent AI
Agent design. If you are looking for one of the best books on A.I, then this
is surely a top pick. There is detailed information on building Agents, graph
algorithms incl. A* Search, and how to navigate in areas of uncertainty. Great
book with lots of content and examples.

### 2\. Deep Learning

[Deep
Learning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262035618/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zeroequalsfal-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0262035618&linkId=84568d05237b805c578061aed460c18f)
is written by a famous ex-Googler, providing a rich and detailed guide into
one of A.Iâs most exciting sub-fields, âMachine Learningâ. In this book you
will learn about Neural Networks and how to construct them for various use-
cases. Itâs been backed by our industry thought-leaders such as Elon Musk who
has commented on how comphresive this book truly is.

### 3\. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and
Statistics)

[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and
Statistics)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387310738/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zeroequalsfal-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0387310738&linkId=af136812be38f404cda557c135deaabc)
is a speciality book on the field of pattern recognition. This is a no bs*
book that covers scientific topics such as Bayesian methods to build A.I
agents. It is a truly an outstanding book for itâs time, and first published
back in 2006.

### 4\. Deep Learning with Python

[Deep Learning with
Python](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617294438/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zeroequalsfal-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1617294438&linkId=e875897693499f3ed3137e2cb2c10493)
combines Deep Learning techniques together with the Python programming
language. Python is generally the preferred language for building AI models â
as it is highly recognised by many large companies and it supports some
exceptional A.I libraries such as Tensorflow to construct A.I agents. This
book will get you up to speed with building A.I using Deep Learning. Prior
knowledge of Python may be advised.

### 5\. The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and
Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics)

[The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction,
Second Edition (Springer Series in
Statistics)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387848576/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zeroequalsfal-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0387848576&linkId=514d719391cc3e1ddb4c8e1ebefeb8c0)
might be one of the best books to gain a solid foundation of statistics, which
really is the backbone of many A.I based applications. Stats helps to drive
the decision-making process of AI such that smart decisions are made. This
book is comphresive and covers Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction â all
relevant and highly applicable today.

The depth value is the z value in a point cloud and pixel value in a depth map(you can access this value by simply reading the value based on pxiel(row index, column index)).

whether it is an Valyrian steel Sword or not â as shown in Figure 2a)_ or
[regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) _(predict a
particular number, e.g. reach of Scorpion canon aiming at dragons as shown in
the top figure 2b)_

## 2\. **Choosing and Building Dataset**

However, I didnât find data sets that I could use for Valerian steel
classification or Scorpion arrow reach regression _(let me know if such data
exists)_ , but instead found a free API to get bitcoin related data over time
instead and since I assume Bitcoin is completely unrelated to Valyrian steel
and Scorpion _(however, I might be wrong about that given that[Valyrian steel
furnaces ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHRcGoje4j4)might compete with
Bitcoin about energy â perhaps a potential [confounding
variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding) to explain a potential
relationship between prices of Valyrian swords and Bitcoin?)_ .

**Scientific selection of Bitcoin data API:** Since I am not an expert in
cryptocurrency I just searched for free bitcoin api _(or something in that
direction)_ and found/selected [cryptocompare.com](http://cryptocompare.com)

### 2.1 Python code to fetch and prepare API data

**Materials & Methods**

I used a colab
([colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)) to fetch and
prepare API data, in combination with AutoML web UI and a few Google Cloud
command line commands (gsutil and gcloud methods). Also used
[Bigquery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) for storing results and AutoML
stored some output related to evaluation in Bigquery

**Imports and authentication (Google Cloud)**

|

CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY = """" # get your own on cryptocompare.com

import requests # for API request to cryptocompare.com

from datetime import datetime as dt

from google.colab import auth, drive

import json

# storing Bitcoin API data in bigquery

from google.cloud import bigquery

from google.api_core.exceptions import BadRequest

auth.authenticate_user() # authentication on Google Cloud

### 2.2 Python Code to prepare Bitcoin data for BigQuery and AutoML Tables

**Actually fetch some results (16000 hours = 1.82 years)**

|

json_results = fetch_and_preprocess(16000, per_api_call_limit=2000)

---|---

**Write as 1 json per line to a file**

|

fh = open(""bitcoindata.json"",""w"")

for line in sorted(json_results):

fh.write(json.dumps(json_results[line]) + ""\n"")

fh.close()

---|---

**Set active Google Cloud project (! in front in colab means shell command
line command)**

|

project_id="""" # the project id you have in google cloud (Web UI)

!gcloud config set project {project_id}

---|---

**Creating a Google Cloud storage bucket to store data**

|

bucket_name = """" # the google cloud bucket name you want

!gsutil mb -c regional -l us-central1 -p {project_id} gs://{bucket_name}

---|---

**Create a Bigquery schema based on the API data fetched**

Note: bigquery-schema-generator was a nice tool, but had to change INTEGER to
FLOAT in the generated schema in addition to prepare data _(ref perl
oneliner)_

|

! pip install bigquery-schema-generator

!generate-schema bitcoindata.json > bitcoindata.schema

!perl -npi -e 's/INTEGER/FLOAT/gi' *.schema

!gsutil cp *.schema gs://{bucket_name}

---|---

**Generate (or fetch existing) Bigquery data set & create Bigquery Table**

Note: I used the project id âpredictingâ, replace with your â ref: bq command
further down.

|

client = bigquery.Client(project=project_id) #

dataset_id = 'bitcoindata' # or whatever you choose

dataset_ref = client.dataset(dataset_id)

try:

client.get_dataset(dataset_ref)

except:

dataset = bigquery.Dataset(dataset_ref)

dataset = client.create_dataset(dataset)

print('Dataset {} created.'.format(dataset.dataset_id))

dataset_ref = client.dataset(dataset_id)

print(dataset_ref)

---|---

|

!bq mk \--table \--expiration 3600 \--description ""This is my table"" \--label
predicting:bitcoindata bitcoindata.bctrainingdata bitcoindata.schema

---|---

**Load API data into (new) Bigquery Table**

|

! bq load \--source_format NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON \

\--ignore_unknown_values \

bitcoindata.bctrainingdata \

gs://predicting/bitcoindata.json \

bitcoindata.schema

---|---

**Check that the table exists and query it**

|

! bq show predicting:bitcoindata

---|---

|

%%bigquery \--project predicting bitcoindata

select * from bitcoindata.bctrainingdata

---|---

![](https://amundtveit.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/05/bigquery_select_bitcoin_data_output.png)**Figure 3 â
output from select query towards Bitcoin data in Bigquery**

**We have input (x) features, but not a feature (y) to predict(!)**

Create a column to predict can be done by creating a new column that is time
shifted, e.g. for a time t=0 there is a particular row that require a t=1
feature to train â the feature we want to predict is the Bitcoin close price
next hour _(e.g. not exactly quant/high-frequency trading â but a more
soothing once-per-hour experience, if it works out ok it can be automated â
for the risk taking?)_. This can be generated either in[ Bigquery with select
and LEAD() method ](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-
sql/functions-and-operators#lead)or with a Python [Pandas Dataframe
shift](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe-shift/) â showing
both approached underneath.

|

%%bigquery \--project predicting bitcoindata

select lead(close) OVER (ORDER BY formatted_timestamp) as NEXTCLOSE, * from
bitcoindata.bctrainingdata ORDER by formatted_timestamp desc

---|---

|

df = df.assign(NEXTCLOSE=tst.loc[:,'close'].shift(1))

# ADDING TIMESTAMP CAN BE USEFUL FOR DEBUGGING, TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE SHIFTING
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION!

df = df.assign(NEXT_TIMESTAMP=tst.loc[:,'formatted_timestamp'].shift(1))

---|---

Prepare final data with NEXTCLOSE column (as csv) for AutoML and copy to
Google Cloud bucket

|

csv_data = bitcoindata_w_prediction_column.to_csv(index=False)

fh = open(""automl_import_data.csv"",""w"")

fh.write(data)

fh.close()

---|---

|

!gsutil cp bq_import_data.csv gs://{bucket_name}

---|---

## 3\. AutoML prediction

Now the data is ready for AutoML _(Note that the step with Bigquery could have
been avoided in this case, but could also be another direction since AutoML
can import directly from Bigquery)_. Underneath you can see an example of a
created dataset in AutoML Console.

## Conclusion

Have shown an example of using AutoML â the main part was about getting data
from an API and preparing to use it (section 2), and using it in AutoML to
train a model and look into evaluation. This model aims to predict the next
hour bitcoin closing based on data from the current hour, but can probably be
extended in several ways â **how would you extend it?**

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence Could Solve Nuclear Fusion's Biggest Problem

By [Irina Slav](https://oilprice.com/contributors/Irina-Slav) \- Apr 18, 2019,
11:00 AM CDT

![Fusion](https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/ee5a54b91abd733ac47550e3cc00717f.jpg)

The predictive powers of artificial intelligence could help scientists bring
nuclear fusion closer to actually working, researchers from Princeton and
Harvard working with the Department of Energy hope.

The team, working at the DoEâs Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory,
[says](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/04/17/artificial-intelligence-
accelerates-efforts-develop-clean-virtually-limitless) they have applied deep
learning techniques to computers in order to be able to forecast sudden
outages in the reactors used for nuclear fusion that can halt the energy-
generating reaction.

The implications of a success here could be major: nuclear fusion can
theoretically supply emissions-free electric power indefinitely. However,
making the leap from theoretical to practical has proved challenging.

Nuclear fusion, unlike fission, which is what takes place in traditional
reactors, involves smashing particles together and turning them into plasma to
generate energy. This takes place in what is called a magnetic fusion machine,
or a tokamak. The tokamak produces magnetic fields that keep the superhot
plasma inside and keep it movingâand hotâbut controlling it for ever-longer
periods of time and making it move faster to produce more energy has been a
[challenge](https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-recipe-for-nuclear-fusion-
could-point-the-way-to-more-efficient-power).

Many believe we will never be able to make nuclear fusion happen, but
researchers are not giving up. Computer technology is a natural ally to
scientists in this quest for infinite clean power, but the presence of data to
feed into the computers has proved crucial.

The Princeton and Harvard scientists used data from two fusion reactors: the
Department of Energyâs DIII-D National Fusion Facility in California, operated
by General Atomics, and the Joint European Torus tokamak in the UK. What the
team learns about predicting outages will be applied to the largest tokamak
that is currently in construction in the ITER project in Europe. It may just
help solve fusionâs biggest problem: why the particle smashing sometimes
stops. If this problem is solved, the world could see a working nuclear
reactor in less than 20 years, although many scientists and observers remain
skeptical.

I expect to insert the messages in real time to firestore and i think that integrating the functionality in dataflow (like a ""apply"" operation) is the best approach.
Does exist a **workaround** to resolve the issue or definitively is a bug of compatibility.
Could you explain if exist another eficiente design to achieve the goal (for example, calling from dataflow to firestore rest/grpc api, the last one implemented in another project).

<p><strong>""Is there any particular reason not to chain functions in CF's?"" ?</strong></p>

<p>As explained in the <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a>, ""Cloud Functions can be associated with a specific trigger"". You can ""chain"" Cloud Functions by creating the corresponding triggers, for example, creating a doc in Firestore in one CF (Callable Function for example), that would trigger another CF that respond to a Firestore trigger). <strong>Having said that, in most cases you can probably cover a lot of needs in a unique Cloud Function, by chaining promises, instead of chaining Cloud Functions</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, I would not recommend to call an HTTP Cloud Function from within a Cloud Function because (IMHO) HTTP Cloud Functions are more designed to be called by an external consumer (I even don't know if this would work). </p>

da-2a57fdd92939>

Abstract: Point cloud data from 3D LiDAR sensors are one of the most crucial
sensor modalities for versatile safety-critical applications such as self-
driving vehicles. Since the annotations of point cloud data is an expensive
and time-consuming process, therefore recently the utilization of simulated
environments and 3D LiDAR sensors for this task started to get some
popularity. With simulated sensors and environments, the process for obtaining
an annotated synthetic point cloud data became much easier. However, the
generated synthetic point cloud data are still missing the artifacts usually
exist in point cloud data from real 3D LiDAR sensors. As a result, the
performance of the trained models on this data for perception tasks when
tested on real point cloud data is degraded due to the domain shift between
simulated and real environments. Thus, in this work, we are proposing a domain
adaptation framework for bridging this gap between synthetic and real point
cloud data. Our proposed framework is based on the deep cycle-consistent
generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) architecture. We have evaluated the
performance of our proposed framework on the task of vehicle detection from a
birdâs eye view (BEV) point cloud images coming from real 3D LiDAR sensors.
The framework has shown competitive results with an improvement of more than
7% in average precision score over other baseline approaches when tested on
real BEV point cloud images.

<p>The second message is saying that your function code is expecting to receive an input object with a property called ""query"" that's an object with a property called ""email"".  But that's not what you're passing from the client.  In the client, you passed a string (I assume, as you didn't say exactly what <code>email</code> is in your swift code).</p>

<p>Futhermore, I suspect that you might be confused about what callable functions take as arguments.  You're showing <code>(req, res)</code> as arguments, a request and a response, which is what you would normally expect from a HTTP type function.  But that's not how callables work.

As a part of the process, I need to write a query to transform data read from csv file and insert to the table in the cloud sql database. So, based on NIFi, I need to write a python to execute a sql queries automatically on a daily basis. But the question here is that how can I write a python to connect with the cloud sql database? What config that should be done? I have read something about cloud sql proxy but can I just use an cloud sql instance's internal ip address and put it in some config file and creating some dbconnector out of it? </p>

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence

Intelligence is indeed a very, very complex word. A human being is of type
Homo sapiens which translates to âwise manâ because our intelligence is so
important to us. For many years, we tried to understand how we think, how we
perceive, understand, and how we predict.

Thinking, Perception, understanding, prediction, and action are all means for
human cognitive behavior and itâs where Artificial Intelligence comes to work.
In short, Artificial Intelligence is the study of building human-level
intelligence in computer programs.

In this Article Weâll cover the following:

â¢ What is Intelligence?

â¢ What is an Algorithm?

â¢ What is Artificial Intelligence?

â¢ Artificial Intelligence Applications

â¢ Summary

Before I dig into defining Artificial Intelligence, I would like to first try
to define Intelligence from my perspective. And introduce you to Algorithms.

 **What Is Intelligence?**

There are many, many ways to define intelligence, some of those definitions
are philosophical âwhich isnât our concern in this post. While others are more
concrete and can be used to âsomehow measure the level of intelligence in
doing a particular task.

Intelligence is the ability to acquire new data from the surrounding
environment, learn, differentiate between things, finding patterns between
seemingly similar things that are different in reality, and finally, take an
action based on reasoning.

I came up with this particular definition because it will help further
understand the idea behind artificial intelligence easily.

 **What is an Algorithm?**

Whenever I want to introduce algorithms to people, I start mentioning Macarena
dance. Yes, I mean it. Let me teach you to dance Macarena.

1\. Put your right arm, facing down, out in front of you.

2\. Put your left arm, facing down, also out in front of you.

3\. Flip over your right arm, then left.

4\. Touch your left shoulder with your right arm, and your right shoulder with
your left arm.

Oh, come on, sure I wonât keep going until youâre a Macarena expert. But,
think of a computer algorithm as those steps you were instructed while
learning to dance, and I am your programmer, I instructed you with clearly
defined steps that would, eventually, lead you into dancing a complete
Macarena.

Thatâs exactly what computer algorithms are. You get a problem that needs a
solution. You start finding out a solution, then write it in the form of
computer instructions that whenever run, it would solve the problem.

Always remember, an algorithm is essential for a computer to reach your
desired output because a computer ONLY knows what you tell them. Artificial
Intelligence is a combination of smart algorithms that seems like magic.

 **What is Artificial Intelligence?**

We talked about human cognitive abilities, and we tried to define intelligence
so that we can go further into better articulating AI.

AI is simply, any technique, algorithm, or computer code that enables
computers âor machines to develop and mimic human-level cognitive behavior. AI
doesnât only study human intelligence; it goes further by attempting to build
intelligent entities.

AI is a very new field in science and engineering. Actually, the term
âArtificial Intelligenceâ was coined in 1956.

In the early days of the AI field, we used to build systems that would âSeem
Intelligentâ by programming virtually all possible human-like decision
processes. It is different now. It is impossible to write a program that
contains every possible human decision, thatâs Artificial Stupidity if we can
name it. We rather now watch how human intelligence makes use of the
surrounding environment and try to come up with mathematical solutions that
can mimic this process.

 **Artificial Intelligence Applications**

AI applications are almost everywhere around us. Itâs on your phone, car,
smartwatch, and soon it is going to be in your washing machine.
<https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/02/samsung-ww8800m-quickdrive-ai-washing-
machine/>

I picked 3 examples of day-to-day artificial intelligence we interact with.

 **1\. Apple Siri**

Almost everyone who uses Apple products is now familiar with Appleâs personal
assistant, Siri. Itâs the friendly voice-activated computer program that comes
with Apple iPhone as well as iPad, iPod, and other Apple products.

Siri basically integrates two important subspecialties in AI which are: Voice
Recognition which is the ability of a computer to understand what you say, and
Natural Language processing which is the ability of a computer to understand
what you write. And a subfield which is: Machine Learning. Machine Learning
technology helps Siri to get smarter and better able to predict and understand
our natural language.

 **2\. Amazon.com**

No surprise in Amazon recommending you the next thing that you would like to
buy. It might seem simple but it is a collection of AI algorithms refined and
developed over time to be as smart as it seems to be now.

Itâs quite intense to learn how likely youâre into buying a particular item.
Amazonâs algorithms are basically machine learning algorithms that tries to
match what you bought with people who bought similar things like you, then
recommend to you what you might like according to your purchases and people-
like-you purchases.

I think Amazon is planning an AI algorithm that would allow it to ship
products to us before we even decide to purchase it. Its imaginary but I can
see it in the horizons.

 **3\. Google search âDid you meanâ**

Now, youâre unconsciously not worried about misspelling a word, a sentence or
even writing in a totally different language while searching google.

You know it is smart enough to understand what you mean. So you hand to Google
the job to correct your grammar, spelling, and everything. Moreover, gets you
the best result you can dream of in the first search result.

Google Search is a whole lot of algorithms that are out this blog post scope.
For the phrase, spelling, and grammar correction, it involves Machine Learning
algorithms that deal with Natural Language Processing.

Finally, AI is a huge field that contains many subfields and technicalities.
AI can now play chess, GO, prove mathematical theorems, write poetry, drive a
car, and diagnose diseases.

<p>Now first of all, running the suggested command doesn't even work because the suggested syntax is bad (missing a value for ""member="").

What I want is that all URLs to be redirected to <code>/wordpress</code>, so that when visitors request <code>www.example.com</code>, they will be redirected to the WordPress app. And just when they give <code>www.example.com/could</code> will be redirected to the cloud app. I have used a <code>.htaccess</code> file, and it looks like the following</p>

<pre><code>&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine on

RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ wrdpress/$1 [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The cloud app works fine, the start page of WordPress too, but whenever I navigate to a post the redirect breaks with <code>ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS</code>. The problem as I can tell is that when I try to open <code>www.example.com/2019/04/some_post</code> the server try to find a sub directory <code>2019</code> in the WordPress directory, which doesn't exist.</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>def hello_get(request)

<p>Cloud Functions handles <strong>all</strong> the work to create the Flask environment and handle the incoming request.  All you need to do is provide the handler to handle the processing.  This is the core behind Cloud Functions which provides ""Serverless"" infrastructure.  The number and existence of <em>actual</em> running servers is removed from your world and you can concentrate only on what you want your logic to do.  It is not surprising that your example program doesn't work as it is trying to do too much.  Here is a link to a Google Cloud Functions tutorial for Python that illustrates a simple sample.</p>

__label__Cloud	Not digressing at all - just unclear what that meant. So if your cloud functions are tied to your data can you not duplicate the cloud functions, or even re-use the cloud function based on which node provided the trigger? Seems to me if you are trying to isolate each developer so they don&#39;t roll over each others data, you need duplicate data and separate functions to react to those changes. Just a thought.

<p>Microsoft already introduced a new OneDrive feature that will make it easier to recover from ransomware attacks. Files Restore is making its way over from OneDrive for Business to personal OneDrive accounts. The catch is youâll need an Office 365 subscription to get access to the new Files Restore feature. OneDrive users can now use it to simply restore files from any point in time within the last 30 days. If you accidentally delete a file youâll be able to restore it, or if you make some bad changes and want to roll back to an earlier copy.</p>

<p>Microsoft is marketing the Files Restore feature as a good way to protect against ransomware attacks that lock files on a local PC, and often try to delete copies that are stored in synced folders â replicating those changes in the cloud. Weâve seen a number of these attacks recently, and victims have been forced to pay money to try and get their files back.</p>

<p>If OneDrive detects mass deletion of cloud files, Microsoft will alert users through an email or mobile / desktop notification and a recovery process will let you quickly restore to a time before the ransomware attack.</p>

<p><strong>OneDrive Files Restore</strong></p>

<p>Alongside this new Files Restore feature, Microsoft is also adding password protected sharing links for OneDrive to make it a little more secure when you share out sensitive files or folders. Outlook.com is also getting updated with email encryption for Office 365 subscribers. The email encryption can be enabled on individual messages, and Outlook.com will even prompt you to encrypt emails if it detects information like social security numbers in messages. Recipients will be able to read the messages in Outlook.com, Outlook for iOS and Android, the Windows Mail app, or just by visiting a link in the email if the level of security at the recipient doesnât meet Microsoftâs encrypted connection standards. Outlook.com users will also be able to prevent recipients from forwarding or copying emails sent from the service.</p>

__label__AI	"Microsoft unveiled a [curriculum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-
us/learn/paths/ai-business-school-government/) in its Artificial Intelligence
Business School this week that is specifically tailored for government
decision-makers.

âThe fact is that government workers across the boardâand especially decision-
makersâdonât necessarily have that familiarity or depth on AI,â Anthony
Salcito, Microsoftâs vice president for government, said in a
[statement](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai-for-business/2019/05/27/government-
ai-school/?utm_source=ai-blog&utm_campaign=1735). âThis new learning path is a
way to get them introduced to the concept and to understand why itâs important
in the context of government work.â

The tech giant launched its AI Business School in March to help executives and
other business leaders better understand how to implement the technology
through a free online master class. Now that more than 140,000 people have
gained practical guidance from the AI course material to date, the company is
offering a new path that is designed especially for government agencies.

Through various course modules, government insiders can learn about the
components that comprise a strong AI strategy, principles to guide responsible
AI adoption, lessons on fostering an âAI-readyâ culture and other insights
around using the tech to better serve their constituents.

The course content also includes a case study demonstrating how a city in
Finland has integrated AI to more efficiently serve citizens and a demo that
showcases how the government can utilize intelligent bots to help constituents
access needed resources, among other materials and a video lecture.

Microsoft is also expressly gearing the curriculum to governments of all sizes
and Salcito said the new learning path is motivated by Microsoftâs âkey
priority,â which is to help the government serve its constituents through
cloud services.

âWe believe this course is valuable for government decision-makers at all
levels â from small municipalities to large cities,â Salcito said. âThe beauty
of artificial intelligence technologies is their scalability.â

__label__AI	"IBMâs artificial intelligence technology has foiled chess masters and
_Jeopardy!_ champions, but it hasnât won a debating competition against a
human -- yet.

Project Debater, a two-meter-tall black box powered by artificial
intelligence, lost to champion debater Harish Natarajan last month in the
first machine-versus-man debate competition of its kind.

It was a loss but not a failure for Project Debater. She (yes, she) was able
to construct arguments and make rebuttals and even used preprogrammed humor.

âI have heard you hold the world record in debate competition wins against
humans, but I suspect you have never debated a machine,â Project Debater said
to Natarajan in her opening remarks. âWelcome to the future.â

IBM wants to use this technology to help people develop more persuasive
arguments and make well-informed decisions, said Dan Lehav, computer scientist
and a debate expert at the company. Humans are good at presenting information
in ways that appeal to other humans, he said. But machines have the ability to
analyze unfathomable amounts of data.

âWe want to bridge those worlds,â said Lehav. âHumans are going to be able to
use this in a complementary way.â

VIDEO

He said the technology has several potential applications in higher education.
College debate is an obvious area. Project Debater could be a practice
opponent, a research aid or even a judge of the strength of students'
arguments -- including those written in essay form.

What makes a âstrongâ argument is something that IBM scientists have grappled
with, said Lehav. Project Debater determines whether there is substantial
evidence for or against an argument by analyzing a corpus of more than 300
million newspaper, magazine and journal articles.

AI can âshine a light on distorted facts to provide diverse, well-informed
viewpoints -- both the pro and the con,â IBM said on its Project Debater
website. âThe rise of one-sided and doctored narratives is challenging society
and our platforms. Too often, we talk past one another. We need a smarter
way.â

Brandon Fleming, founder and CEO of the [Harvard Debate Council Diversity
Project](https://www.harvarddcdp.org/about), said he is excited about the
potential applications of the technology in academe. âThe technology is simply
revolutionary,â he said in an email. âProject Debater has the potential to
empower our ability to think critically and communicate effectively.â

Fleming said he wants to use the technology to train college debaters in
rhetoric, research and argumentation. âThe speed at which Project Debater can
generate arguments would provide more content for my students to explore and
critique,â he said. This would âinherently accelerate and enhance the amount
of academic conditioning that one training session could allot -- producing
stronger students in a shorter period of time.â

More generally, he said the technology could be used in classrooms to
encourage students to engage in critical examinations of research and
argumentation. âIn addition to information, Project Debater provides instant
access to reason. Information and reason coalesce into ideas and arguments.
Argumentation is the vehicle by which ideas are exchanged, challenged and
perfected.â

However, not everyone is enthusiastic about the potential of AI in college
debate. Jeffrey Jarman, director of the Elliott School of Communication and
former director of debate at Wichita State University, said he could see a
role for AI in helping students improve their debating skills, but with ""lots
of caveats and cautions.""

""I""m not sure how much the AI understands the full process of argumentation,""
said Jarman in an email. Debating is about more than just finding strong
arguments, he said. ""We have to shape and alter our arguments based on the
particular audience we are speaking to. It isn't clear that the AI is
sophisticated enough to do that yet.""

Scott Varda, associate professor of communication and associate director of
debate at Baylor University, said the IBM technology was âimpressiveâ but had
limitations. In the live debate, Varda felt Project Debater struggled to grasp
nuance and lacked creativity. âDebate is both an art and a science,â he said.

While Project Debater could be used to train champion debaters, Varda doesnât
think this would be a scalable or particularly useful application of the
technology. A better use might be tapping AIâs analytical power to help
academics mine scholarly literature, he said, perhaps to identify new drug
targets in medical research.

Sarah Partlow-Lefevre, a professor of communications and director of debate at
Idaho State University, agreed that Project Debaterâs debating skills were
limited. She likened the AIâs performance in the live debate to that of a
novice debater. âIt was able to compile all the information but didnât know
how to use it.""

The AI started with an advantage over its human opponent because it had access
to a treasure trove of raw data and facts, said Partlow-Lefevre. But it fell
down on connecting with the audience through humor, eye contact, delivery and
subtlety of argument. âIt didnât feel able to maintain a consistent policy
position and didnât quite understand the nuance of all the arguments,â she
said.

Training regimes for college debaters are usually low-tech affairs, said
Partlow-Lefevre. Pen drills, where students speak while biting down on a pen,
are used to help students improve their enunciation. Speed reading helps
students to process information faster. Students also are encouraged to film
themselves and review the video to see where they can improve their delivery.

AI could be a useful sparring partner for college debaters in training, or
help them to conduct research, said Partlow-Lefevre. But she predicts that use
of this technology in a competition setting would prove contentious. In
competitions where students are given just minutes to prepare their arguments,
even allowing access to the internet is unusual and deemed âvery
controversial.â

Partlow-Lefevre worries that access to the technology might only be available
to students at the wealthiest institutions -- possibly giving them an unfair
advantage over their opponents. She also questions whether the use of AI would
be deemed intellectually honest by college debate judges.

The world of college debate ""is slow to change,"" she said.

""View Original"")

RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. -- A project of the U.S. Army has developed a new
framework for deep neural networks that allows artificial intelligence systems
to better learn new tasks while forgetting less of what they have learned
regarding previous tasks.

The North Carolina State University researchers, funded by the Army, have also
demonstrated that using the framework to learn a new task can make the AI
better at performing previous tasks, a phenomenon called backward transfer.

""The Army needs to be prepared to fight anywhere in the world so its
intelligent systems also need to be prepared,"" said Dr. Mary Anne Fields,
program manager for Intelligent Systems at Army Research Office, an element of
U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command's Army Research Lab. ""We
expect the Army's intelligent systems to continually acquire new skills as
they conduct missions on battlefields around the world without forgetting
skills that have already been trained. For instance, while conducting an urban
operation, a wheeled robot may learn new navigation parameters for dense urban
cities, but it still needs to operate efficiently in a previously encountered
environment like a forest.""

The research team proposed a new framework, called Learn to Grow, for
continual learning, which decouples network structure learning and model
parameter learning. In experimental testing it outperformed pervious
approaches to continual learning.

""Deep neural network AI systems are designed for learning narrow tasks,"" said
Xilai Li, a co-lead author of the paper and a Ph.D. candidate at NC State. ""As
a result, one of several things can happen when learning new tasks, systems
can forget old tasks when learning new ones, which is called catastrophic
forgetting. Systems can forget some of the things they knew about old tasks,
while not learning to do new ones as well. Or systems can fix old tasks in
place while adding new tasks -- which limits improvement and quickly leads to
an AI system that is too large to operate efficiently. Continual learning,
also called lifelong-learning or learning-to-learn, is trying to address the
issue.""

To understand the Learn to Grow framework, think of deep neural networks as a
pipe filled with multiple layers. Raw data goes into the top of the pipe, and
task outputs come out the bottom. Every ""layer"" in the pipe is a computation
that manipulates the data in order to help the network accomplish its task,
such as identifying objects in a digital image. There are multiple ways of
arranging the layers in the pipe, which correspond to different
""architectures"" of the network.

When asking a deep neural network to learn a new task, the Learn to Grow
framework begins by conducting something called an explicit neural
architecture optimization via search. What this means is that as the network
comes to each layer in its system, it can decide to do one of four things:
skip the layer; use the layer in the same way that previous tasks used it;
attach a lightweight adapter to the layer, which modifies it slightly; or
create an entirely new layer.

This architecture optimization effectively lays out the best topology, or
series of layers, needed to accomplish the new task. Once this is complete,
the network uses the new topology to train itself on how to accomplish the
task -- just like any other deep learning AI system.

""We've run experiments using several datasets, and what we've found is that
the more similar a new task is to previous tasks, the more overlap there is in
terms of the existing layers that are kept to perform the new task,"" Li said.
""What is more interesting is that, with the optimized -- or ""learned"" topology
-- a network trained to perform new tasks forgets very little of what it
needed to perform the older tasks, even if the older tasks were not similar.""

The researchers also ran experiments comparing the Learn to Grow framework's
ability to learn new tasks to several other continual learning methods, and
found that the Learn to Grow framework had better accuracy when completing new
tasks.

To test how much each network may have forgotten when learning the new task,
the researchers then tested each system's accuracy at performing the older
tasks -- and the Learn to Grow framework again outperformed the other
networks.

""In some cases, the Learn to Grow framework actually got better at performing
the old tasks,"" said Caiming Xiong, the research director of Salesforce
Research and a co-author of the work. ""This is called backward transfer, and
occurs when you find that learning a new task makes you better at an old task.
We see this in people all the time; not so much with AI.""

""This Army investment extends the current state of the art machine learning
techniques that will guide our Army Research Laboratory researchers as they
develop robotic applications, such as intelligent maneuver and learning to
recognize novel objects,"" Fields said. ""This research brings AI a step closer
to providing our warfighters with effective unmanned systems that can be
deployed in the field.""

The paper, ""Learn to Grow: A Continual Structure Learning Framework for
Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting,"" will be presented at the 36th
International Conference on Machine Learning, being held June 9-15 in Long
Beach, California. Co-lead authors of the paper are Tianfu Wu, Ph.D., an
assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at NC State, Xilai
Li, a doctoral student at NC State, and Yingbo Zhou of Salesforce Research.
The paper was co-authored by Richard Socher and Caiming Xiong of Salesforce
Research.

The work was also supported by the National Science Foundation. Part of the
work was done while Li was a summer intern at Salesforce AI Research.

Firefox from

[mozilla.org](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/cd575b688061106e82588d273087096c5db5c94715f1a71eacd20a65d434f7b7/http%3A//mozilla.org)

& mozilla's ""Firefox for Android"" from Play store

 **Not supported for use in**

Firefox variants, like TBB, Palemoon, Waterfox etc, also not for use with
""proxy addons"".

**What is Cloud Firewall?**

\- Cloud Firewall is a browser extension/addon that allows you to toggle
blocking ON or OFF for allowing your browser to connect to web pages and web
resources (like images, videos) hosted on popular top 5 cloud/companies.

Example 1: If ""Block Amazon"" is toggled ON in Popup, all websites hosted on
Amazon AWS will be blocked. Future version of addon will have a ""allow all
clouds in this site"" button in UI for excluding some sites from blocking
rules.

Example 2: If ""Block Amazon"" is toggled ON in Popup, let's say a website is
hosted ""on-premise (not in cloud)"", but has some ""resources"" like images,
video and scripts hosted on Amazon AWS cloud, only those ""3rd party"" resources
are blocked. ""3rd party"" = these resources. ""1st party"" = site in address bar
+ resources delivered from same domain on-premise server.

\- By default, in version 0.0.1.x, the toggle state ON or OFF in popup menu is
not persisted across browser restarts. When browser starts, all 5 toggles are
set to OFF , i.e allow connections to all 5 cloud by default. You have the
option to open popup menu and toggle ON or OFF against each cloud that you
wish to block or allow.

List**](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a109e318604c3c9b569c234376e21b2e75b2cca5dde657bb641cb1196b7843db/https%3A//github.com/gkrishnaks/awesome-
humane-tech) **Inspiration:**

\- The inspiration behind the creation of this addon was the ""Life without the
tech giants"" series by Kashmir Hill and Dhruv Mehrotra. Read it here :

[Gizmodo
series](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/e830511f196ed3a6b872a4c75e498f818fd73b879b4c2dc50f34514d1892cac9/https%3A//gizmodo.com/life-
without-the-tech-giants-1830258056)

and Dhruv Mehrotra published the VPN tool in his

[ Github
](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/c128900c29571aa9c9f3a8b934fa6bf3f46cb97ac43692da0a83f0ebeb8b9f0a/https%3A//github.com/dmehrotra/GoodbyeBigFive)

\- I used the AS.csv from his repository and the BASH script to generate the
list of IPv4/IPv6 CIDR blocks/ranges owned by each of the 5 companies

 **Purpose:**

\-

_Experience_

the web as though major cloud companies are not available, so that we can
visualize how much of the WWW is hosted in some cloud providers

\-

_Research:_

similar to Kashmir Hill's series, you can conduct research on how many times
your browser connects to major top 5 tech companies when you browse the WWW.
(Please let the developer know if this addon helps with your research)

\-

_Website Testing:_

If you are a website developer or site owner, and have some resources like
javascript or images or videos hosted in Cloud providers like AWS or Azure or
Google Cloud, use this addon for testing your website behaviour for the case
where the whole Cloud region goes down. (Please let the developer know if this
addon helps with testing your websites)

 **How does it work?**

\- Addon comes bundled with a list of all IP address ranges CIDR blocks in
both IPV4 and IPV6 owned by top 5 tech companies. Refer ""Inspiration"" section
above for the source of this list.

\- Whenever a page is loaded, all the resources in the page from address bar
URL to embedded images, javascript files and other resources (like video) are
resolved from DNS to IP address, and the IP address is checked against the
known list of IP ranges owned by each company

\- If ""Block {company}"" switch is toggled ON in popup, the connection is
blocked if the resolved IP is within a known range of the selected company.

\- Addon uses local offline storage to store a cache of hostnames so that
subsqeuent page loads are faster. Domainnames are stored as base64 SHA256
digest sums. User has the option to delete this cache OR disable cache storage
from Settings page

\- In future versions, we will research an optional setting to AES256 encrypt
this cache

\- When caching is enabled, cache is compressed and written to disk once every
four minutes to avoid multiple disk writes

\-

*****NOTE**:**

it uses the

[DNS.resolve WebExt
API](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/ca8846835a9788a81627bdafdc960705a49435c180a470318848970b3643afd4/https%3A//developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns/resolve)

made available by Firefox to WebExtensions. The implementation of this API is
inside browser, and browser may use SYSTEM's DNS resolver to resolve DNS to
IP. Therefore only the official Firefox versions from Mozilla are supported,
namely ""Firefox"" from

[mozilla.org](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/5688239e82f438f30854055e084cb2233d530bee4a660bb381f11d318ec27d8f/https%3A//mozilla.org)

or Mozilla's ""Firefox For Android"" from Play store.

\- Hence it's

**not recommended**

to use this addon with other Firefox variants, like TBB, Palemoon, Waterfox
etc. Also why it's

**not recommended**

to use with any ""proxy addons"" you may find in Mozilla Addons store. Please
see Issue

[[#18]](https://outgoing.prod.mozaws.net/v1/a7ab22beeaf4f8153b2a38d176d56a175c26bdfd0355d32da2514dd8901ac7f8/https%3A//gitlab.com/gkrishnaks/cloud-
firewall/issues/18)

if you wish to help change this

**Stats in Popup Menu**

\- Stats are displayed in popup menu. Stats include the number of connections
blocked by the addon per company, and total connections blocked count across
all.

\- Since the stat counts are per-device (per-install) statistics, it is not
included in Export/Import setting feature. (Export/Import settings option will
be added in a future version)

\- To avoid multiple disk writes, stats are stored to disk once every four
minutes. It's fine if browser is closed before a four minute window as stats
are not a critical value :)

<p>Page 4 of a recent publication from Oct 2018 seems to suggest that Snakemake does not work on AWS as it cannot handle resource management. Here is the publication: <em>Tibanna: software for scalable execution of portable pipelines on the cloud</em> - <a href=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/04/29/440974.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/04/29/440974.full.pdf</a> </p>

<p>Yes, the same paper does suggest the Snakemake works well with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</p>

<p>However, the Snakemake documentation  states: ""Snakemake 4.0 and later supports execution in the cloud via Kubernetes. This is independent of the cloud provider."" - <a href=""https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html#cloud-support"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html#cloud-support</a></p>

<p>Hence, I would like to know if anyone has implemented Snakemake with AWS Batch.</p>

<p>Also, while on this question, does anyone know of any github/bitbucket page that details the successful implementation of Snakemake with the GCP.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what may be the reason? A wrong instantiation, or something of that sorts? </p>

<p>P.S: No, the incoming cloud is not empty. In fact, I run the code <em>after</em> I get a couple of clouds.</p>

<p>The message will disappear when you declare a Cloud Function in your <code>index.js</code>/<code>index.ts</code>. For example, the documentation on <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started#add-the-addmessage-function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">getting started</a> contains this example:</p>

<p>As you can see, this code <em>uses</em> <code>functions</code> in its first line. So if you add this (or any other Cloud Functions declaration) to your code, you're <em>using</em> <code>functions</code> and <code>eslint</code> will no longer warn you about it not being used.</p>

It would not be scalable to scan an entire collection, performing any sort of transformation (bitwise or otherwise) to come up with matching documents.  In fact, Firestore does not allow any queries that can't be serviced by an efficient index lookup of document fields.</p>

<p>You could try to precompute the expected transformations and store the results of those for querying.  But if you want very flexible querying based on values that are not known ahead of time, Firestore isn't the right tool for the job.</p>

Not long ago I wrote a blog post about the impact that Artificial Intelligence
has on recruitment practices. It seems like many industries face challenges in
recruiting and retaining talents. But in the past two years, human resource
specialists found a new way of making their work more efficient. Yes, itâs
technology, and it is Artificial Intelligence.

You may wonder how AI can help the retention of your valuable employees. After
some research, I found my answers and created the infographic below where you
can find more details about what determined the AI adoption in human resource
departments and what the benefits of using these types of tools.

__label__AI	"SAN FRANCISCO â In 2004, Geoffrey Hinton doubled down on his pursuit of a
technological idea called a neural network.

It was a way for machines to see the world around them, recognize sounds and
even understand natural language. But scientists had spent more than 50 years
working on the concept of neural networks, and machines couldnât really do any
of that.

Backed by the Canadian government, Dr. Hinton, a computer science professor at
the University of Toronto, organized a new research community with several
academics who also tackled the concept. They included Yann LeCun, a professor
at New York University, and Yoshua Bengio at the University of Montreal.

On Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the worldâs largest
society of computing professionals, announced that Drs. Hinton, LeCun and
Bengio had won this yearâs Turing Award for their work on neural networks. The
Turing Award, which was introduced in 1966, is often called the Nobel Prize of
computing, and it includes a $1 million prize, which the three scientists will
share.

Over the past decade, the big idea nurtured by these researchers has
reinvented the way technology is built, accelerating the development of [face-
recognition services](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/business/newspaper-
shooting-facial-recognition.html?module=inline), [talking digital
assistants](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/17/technology/alexa-
siri-conversation.html?module=inline), [warehouse
robots](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/business/warehouse-robots-
learning.html?module=inline) and [self-driving
cars](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/technology/self-driving-cars-
aurora.html?module=inline). Dr. Hinton is now at Google, and Dr. LeCun works
for Facebook. Dr. Bengio has inked deals with IBM and Microsoft.

âWhat we have seen is nothing short of a paradigm shift in the science,â said
Oren Etzioni, the chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for
Artificial Intelligence in Seattle and a prominent voice in the A.I.
community. âHistory turned their way, and I am in awe.â

Loosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain, a [neural
network](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/technology/google-artificial-
intelligence.html?module=inline) is a complex mathematical system that can
learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousands
of old phone calls, for example, it can learn to recognize spoken words.

This allows many artificial intelligence technologies to progress at a rate
that was not possible in the past. Rather than coding behavior into systems by
hand â one logical rule at a time â computer scientists can build technology
that learns behavior largely on its own.

The London-born Dr. Hinton, 71, first embraced the idea as a graduate student
in the early 1970s, a time when most artificial intelligence researchers
turned against it. Even his own Ph.D. adviser questioned the choice.

âWe met once a week,â Dr. Hinton said in an interview. âSometimes it ended in
a shouting match, sometimes not.â

Neural networks had a brief revival in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After a
year of postdoctoral research with Dr. Hinton in Canada, the Paris-born Dr.
LeCun moved to AT&Tâs Bell Labs in New Jersey, where he designed a neural
network that could read handwritten letters and numbers. An AT&T subsidiary
sold the system to banks, and at one point it read about 10 percent of all
checks written in the United States.

Though a neural network could read handwriting and help with some other tasks,
it could not make much headway with big A.I. tasks, like recognizing faces and
objects in photos, identifying spoken words, and understanding the natural way
people talk.

âThey worked well only when you had lots of training data, and there were few
areas that had lots of training data,â Dr. LeCun, 58, said.

But some researchers persisted, including the Paris-born Dr. Bengio, 55, who
worked alongside Dr. LeCun at Bell Labs before taking a professorship at the
University of Montreal.

In 2004, with less than $400,000 in funding from the Canadian Institute for
Advanced Research, Dr. Hinton created a research program dedicated to what he
called âneural computation and adaptive perception.â He invited Dr. Bengio and
Dr. LeCun to join him.

By the end of the decade, the idea had caught up with its potential. In 2010,
Dr. Hinton and his students helped Microsoft, IBM, and Google push the
boundaries of speech recognition. Then they did much the same with image
recognition.

âHe is a genius and knows how to create one impact after another,â said Li
Deng, a former speech researcher at Microsoft who brought Dr. Hintonâs ideas
into the company.

Dr. Hintonâs image recognition breakthrough was based on an algorithm
developed by Dr. LeCun. In late 2013, Facebook hired the N.Y.U. professor to
build a research lab around the idea. Dr. Bengio resisted offers to join one
of the big tech giants, but the research he oversaw in Montreal helped drive
the progress of [systems that aim to understand natural
language](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/technology/artificial-
intelligence-language.html?module=inline) and technology that can [generate
fake photos that are indistinguishable from the real
thing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/02/technology/ai-generated-
photos.html?module=inline).

Though these systems have undeniably accelerated the progress of artificial
intelligence, they are still a very long way from true intelligence. But Drs.
Hinton, LeCun and Bengio believe that new ideas will come.

âWe need fundamental additions to this toolbox we have created to reach
machines that operate at the level of true human understanding,â Dr. Bengio
said.

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence

###  **What is AI?**

The most frequently used word in fields of technology is Artificial
Intelligence(AI). It is as cool as it sounds and so it has always been
intriguing me. It is hard to define AI in one single sentence, but it can be
considered as making machines intelligent. That is making machines perform
tasks like reasoning, problem solving, learning, planning and perception which
are basically executed by human brain.

Artificial Intelligence was firstly applied just on game playing(like chess),
but now its application has widened beyond our imagination. It is now
everywhere, in health care, manufacturing, education, finance, law and in
various kinds of businesses. The words(which are also closely related to AI)
like Machine Learning(ML), Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Robotics are
no new to most of us. But for those who are not aware, here is a short
explanation:

Â· **Machine Learning** : It is an application of AI which gives the ability to
learn and improve from experience automatically(like human brain! Though most
of us donât really âimproveâ from experience :P).

Â· **NLP** : It is the ability of machines to understand human language.

Â· **Robotics** : It consists of designing and building robots which often
perform tasks that are difficult even for humans to perform(letâs just not
forget Spirit and Opportunity Rovers!)

Artificial Intelligence can be categorized into two parts: Weak AI and Strong
AI. Weak AI is designed to do some specific tasks, and its most simple example
is Appleâs Siri. Strong AI consists of generalized human cognitive abilities.
It can be used in complex situations to find out answers which may be
uncertain; IBM Watson is the best example of it. While narrow AI may
outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or
solving equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.

###  **Benefits**

 **1\. Increase in work efficiency** : AI-powered machines can work 24X7,
unlike humans. For example, AI-powered chat assistants can answer customer
queries and provide support to visitors every minute of the day.

 **2\. More accurate work** : As AI eliminates the compulsion of
[human](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2018/11/27/want-a-bigger-bang-
from-ai-embed-it-into-your-apps/#b6c0d34e2d5b) intervention and hence, removes
all scope for human error.

 **3\. Reduced cost of training and operation** : AI uses machine learning
algorithms like Deep Learning and neural networks to learn new things like
humans do. This way they eliminate the need to write new code every time we
need them to learn new things.

 **4\. Improved processes** : AI-powered machines can collect a large amount
of data for any particular work allowing us to gather deep insights.

 **5\. Difficult exploration:** Robots can be put to use in mining and other
dangerous exploration which may be dangerous for humans. For example, AI-
powered machines can be used to explore ocean floor, hence overcoming human
limitations.

 **6\. Enhanced Automation** : AI can performs intensive human labour easily
without the need for human intervention.

###  **Risks**

Well it is obvious that there are lots of benefits of AI and it has been a
dream for a long time for humans to create machines that have the ability to
take decisions on their own. However, it is feared by some notable individuals
like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk. Here are some reasons why AI seems scary:

 **1.** **Unemployment** : Automation will obviously eliminate human roles in
certain jobs and hence lead to large scale of unemployment.

 **2.** **Threat to privacy** : It is possible to track and analyse an
individualâs every move online. Cameras are nearly everywhere, and facial
recognition algorithms know who you are.

 **3\. Autonomous weapons** : Many countries are developing autonomous weapons
in the form of battlefield robots. If these bots are self-improving, it may
lead to unintended consequences.

 **4.** **Discrimination:** It is wonderful that machines can now collect so
much of data for some specific purposes. But as they can track and analyse so
much about us, our data can be used against us. Imagine, you are not insurable
because the insurance company caught you many times on the camera talking on
the phone.

These risks cannot be neglected, but as the good outweigh the bad, steps
should be taken to reduce the risks; like some ethical codes and policies
should be created to ensure that the risks associated with AI are reduced to
the minimum.

###  **Future of AI**

1\. Automated transportation: Self driving vehicles will be a common thing in
future. This may help in reducing the possibilities of accidents.

2\. Researchers believe that humans will be able to augment themselves with
computers and enhance their own natural abilities. For example, brain will be
able to communicate with the robotic limb to give the patient more control
over it.

3\. Robots: Presently, robots do not have emotions, but in future robots may
be able to read human emotions and even produce their own; they will be good
friends to us by helping us to stay happy. Moreover, robots will help elderly
people for doing every day work, helping them to stay independent.

4\. There may be some technology to connect the human brain with the machines.
Like, you just have to think of switching on the TV for actually switching it
on!"

__label__Cloud	"<p>The answer given by @g00glen00b did not work exactly as written.  But his suggestion to use an EL expression to pass in a Spring bean to the filter was spot on, and did work, though in a slightly different way.  For reference, in addition to the code I posted above, here is the skeleton of my custom gateway filter class:</p>

<pre><code>@Component
public class AuthorizationFilter implements GatewayFilterFactory&lt;Config&gt; {
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public AuthorizationFilter(RestTemplate restTemplate) {
        this.restTemplate = restTemplate;
    }

    @Override
    public GatewayFilter apply(Config config) {
        return (exchange, chain) -&gt; {
            // possibly block the request should
            // authorization fail, otherwise allow

            return chain.filter(exchange);
        };
    }

    // I did not use this class at all
    @Override
    public Config newConfig() {
        return new Config(""AuthorizationFilter"");
    }

    public static class Config {
    // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the <code>application.yaml</code> file I used:</p>

<pre><code>spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: statusget
          uri: http://localhost:8081/
          predicates:
            - Method=GET
            - Path=/status
          filters:
            - RewritePath=/status, /v2/status
            - name: AuthorizationFilter
              args:
                restTemplate: ""#{@restTemplate}""
</code></pre>

<p>What I observed is that <code>restTemplate</code> bean specified in <code>args</code> above in fact gets injected into the constructor of the custom filter, when there is an incoming request and a new instance of the filter is needed.</p>

If you really want to start from scratch within ParaView, you need to increment this requested timestep yourself.</p>

<p>Newest version of VeloView (unreleased) uses the same mechanism as ParaView âLiveSourceâ plugin (available in 5.6+), where the plugin tells ParaView to set a QtTimer that will automatically increment the available and requested timesteps.</p>

<p><code>request-&gt;Set(vtkStreamingDemandDrivenPipeline::CONTINUE_EXECUTING(), 1);</code> relates to another mechanism that will run request Data multiple time, but wonât take care of updating the requested timestep.</p>

__label__AI	"_**Summary:** Artificial intelligence technology is able to objectively
differentiate between those with PTSD and those without by analyzing speech
samples, with 89.1% accuracy._

 **Source:** NYU Langone Health

 **A specially designed computer program can help diagnose post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans by analyzing their voices, a new study
finds.**

Published online April 22 in the journal _Depression and Anxiety_ , the study
found that an artificial intelligence tool can distinguish â with 89 percent
accuracy â between the voices of those with or without PTSD.

âOur findings suggest that speech-based characteristics can be used to
diagnose this disease, and with further refinement and validation, may be
employed in the clinic in the near future,â says senior study author Charles
R. Marmar, MD, the Lucius N. Littauer Professor and chair of the Department of
Psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine.

More than 70 percent of adults worldwide experience a traumatic event at some
point in their lives, with up to 12 percent of people in some struggling
countries suffering from PTSD. Those with the condition experience strong,
persistent distress when reminded of a triggering event.

The study authors say that a PTSD diagnosis is most often determined by
clinical interview or a self-report assessment, both inherently prone to
biases. This has led to efforts to develop objective, measurable, physical
markers of PTSD progression, much like laboratory values for medical
conditions, but progress has been slow.

 **Learning How to Learn**

In the current study, the research team used a statistical/machine learning
technique, called random forests, that has the ability to âlearnâ how to
classify individuals based on examples. Such AI programs build âdecisionâ
rules and mathematical models that enable decision-making with increasing
accuracy as the amount of training data grows.

The researchers first recorded standard, hours-long diagnostic interviews,
called Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, or CAPS, of 53 Iraq and Afghanistan
veterans with military-service-related PTSD, as well as those of 78 veterans
without the disease. The recordings were then fed into voice software from SRI
International â the institute that also invented Siri â to yield a total of
40,526 speech-based features captured in short spurts of talk, which the
teamâs AI program sifted through for patterns.

The random forest program linked patterns of specific voice features with
PTSD, including less clear speech and a lifeless, metallic tone, both of which
had long been reported anecdotally as helpful in diagnosis. While the current
study did not explore the disease mechanisms behind PTSD, the theory is that
traumatic events change brain circuits that process emotion and muscle tone,
which affects a personâs voice.

Moving forward, the research team plans to train the AI voice tool with more
data, further validate it on an independent sample, and apply for government
approval to use the tool clinically.

âSpeech is an attractive candidate for use in an automated diagnostic system,
perhaps as part of a future PTSD smartphone app, because it can be measured
cheaply, remotely, and non-intrusively,â says lead author Adam Brown, PhD,
adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU School of
Medicine.

âThe speech analysis technology used in the current study on PTSD detection
falls into the range of capabilities included in our speech analytics platform
called SenSay Analyticsâ¢,â says Dimitra Vergyri, director of SRI
Internationalâs Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory. âThe
software analyzes words â in combination with frequency, rhythm, tone, and
articulatory characteristics of speech â to infer the state of the speaker,
including emotion, sentiment, cognition, health, mental health and
communication quality. The technology has been involved in a series of
industry applications visible in startups like Oto, Ambit and Decoded Health.â

 **Abstract**

 **Speechâbased markers for posttraumatic stress disorder in US veterans**

 **Background**
The diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is usually based on
clinical interviews or selfâreport measures. Both approaches are subject to
underâ and overâreporting of symptoms. An objective test is lacking. We have
developed a classifier of PTSD based on objective speechâmarker features that
discriminate PTSD cases from controls.

 **Methods**
Speech samples were obtained from warzoneâexposed veterans, 52 cases with PTSD
and 77 controls, assessed with the ClinicianâAdministered PTSD Scale.
Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) were excluded. Audio
recordings of clinical interviews were used to obtain 40,526 speech features
which were input to a random forest (RF) algorithm.

 **Results**
The selected RF used 18 speech features and the receiver operating
characteristic curve had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.954. At a
probability of PTSD cut point of 0.423, Youdenâs index was 0.787, and overall
correct classification rate was 89.1%. The probability of PTSD was higher for
markers that indicated slower, more monotonous speech, less change in
tonality, and less activation. Depression symptoms, alcohol use disorder, and
TBI did not meet statistical tests to be considered confounders.

 **Conclusions**
This study demonstrates that a speechâbased algorithm can objectively
differentiate PTSD cases from controls. The RF classifier had a high AUC.
Further validation in an independent sample and appraisal of the classifier to
identify those with MDD only compared with those with PTSD comorbid with MDD
is required.

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence Can Now Copy Your Voice

## Voice spying, cloning and voice reading on our mental health is just the
beginning

Voice technologies arenât just becoming the new customer touch point, itâs
becoming a new way to gather data from global citizens. Baiduâs AI can [clone
your voice in seconds](https://medium.com/syncedreview/baidu-ai-can-clone-
your-voice-in-seconds-93558a7b984f).

Microsoft has a vision for[ conversational
AI](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/microsoft-build-future-of-natural-
language/) in the future of the operating system. So does Huawei and many
others. Smart speakers are probably spying on us gathering insights not just
to improve their product.

Honestly, they can even [tell if your have
PTSD](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence-detect-ptsd-voice) just by
your voice. Just as AI with facial recognition can read your emotions on your
face. Meanwhile AI is giving us the ability o create fake humans, personas
with apparently human features that donât really exist. Getting catfishes on
the internet by a fake human is now a real possibility in the not too distant
future.

  * It takes just[ 3.7 seconds of audio to clone a voice](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3k7mgn/baidu-deep-voice-software-can-clone-anyones-voice-with-just-37-seconds-of-audio).
  * Todayâs intelligent assistants are full of skills and they will get much smarter in the 2020s.

AI isnât just monetizing the internet for Ad-giants like Google, Facebook and
Amazon, Artificial Intelligence is about to create a fake world of even more
complexity.

Smart speakers are going to explode in popularity in China in 2019, with
Alibaba, Baidu and Xiaomi leading the way among others. Alibaba isnât just
like Amazon, itâs bigger. As it matures in the cloud and as Huaweiâs profits
increase, these two companies will eventually pose a real threat to AI
dominance of Google and Microsoft.

AI is creating a new world and we donât really know the dangers of it, weâre
just going ahead like children into a world where AI regulation will become
nearly impossible.

Now, with advances in artificial intelligence, the world is becoming more
artificial, and you canât be sure what you see or hear is real or a
fabrication of artificial intelligence and machine learning. From incredible
Ads of the future to âentitiesâ we meet online, AI will transform our world to
not just being more immersive, but more confusing, complex and manipulative.

The line between convenience and hacking humans (the opposite of enhancing us)
is very real. Itâs so profitable to use AI to gain an edge over other firms
and reach people, the commercial weaponization of AI and our most intimate
data is really inevitable.

Baiduâs research team used voice cloning techniques to develop the AI system
which they expect will have noteworthy applications in personalizing human-
machine interface.

Baiduâs research arm announced yesterday that its 2017 text-to-speech (TTS)
system _Deep Voice_ has learned [how to imitate a personâs
voice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06006.pdf) using a mere three seconds of
voice sample data. ([Synced](https://medium.com/@Synced) is a great
publication for AI).

Huawei has been working on [emotionally intelligent
AI](https://www.brecorder.com/2018/04/24/413804/huawei-to-introduce-
emotionally-intelligent-artificial-intelligence/) for years. Alexa, Apple and
Samsung are in the race for smarter interacts with their personal assistant AI
via earpods with 2019 being a pivotal year for the product from all three
providers.

Like all artificial intelligence algorithms, the more data voice cloning tools
such as Deep Voice receive to train with the more realistic the results.
Meanwhile companies like Spotify are integrating podcasts into how they
recommend content that will be able to gather data on some of our core
interests.

The smart home invasion of Alexa and Google Home devices is nothing short of a
treasure chest of our most intimate data. Information on demand and insights
on users that were previously impossible. All thanks to the AI-voice interface
which is more immediate and will become ubiquitous in human societies, smart
cities and the IoT in the next twenty years.

The technique known as voice cloning, could be used to personalize virtual
assistants such as Appleâs Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa; and Baiduâs
Mandarin virtual assistant platform DuerOS, which supports more than 50
million devices in China with human-machine conversational interfaces.

The frontiers of human interaction with AIs are broad and deep with incredible
implications for customer relationships. The world we are building of AIs will
be incredible and potentially very transparent with regards to our data.

Google unveiled[ Tacotron
2](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/12/tacotron-2-generating-human-like-
speech.html), a text-to-speech system that leverages the companyâs deep neural
network and speech generation
method[WaveNet](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-
audio/). WaveNet analyzes a visual representation of audio called a
spectrogram to generate audio. It is used to generate the voice for Google
Assistant.

Itâs becoming impossible to tell the difference between an AI and a human and
thatâs incredibly problematic in a world where cybersecurity threats are only
increasing. The internet of things aspect of connectivity in the 4th
industrial revolution comes at a cost for privacy, censorship, data
harvesting, fraud, identity theft and consumer manipulation of ever more
personalized digital advertisements.

It sounded like a pretty normal feature in my head. I've seen plenty if small

into Google drive. Half of the guides I read seem normal, but then the other
half... I'm running into Google telling me to ""enable Billing"" in these

storage services. Good lord... I just wanna let my users upload some silly
pictures to their personal Google drives.

So all the guides are vaguely interconnected and I can't be certain what's
what. I don't want to waste my life on guides that will tell me 20 hours down
the road that I REALLY need to give google 1000 dollars a month for something
so basic.

So, am I crazy, or what? Can a dev who's run into this question before confirm
if my intended feature is possible without selling google my left kidney? I
don't mind doing the research and coding myself, but I gotta know if it's a
waste of time to even start.

# Artificial Intelligence in Retail

## So whatâs the big picture look like for the future of retail?

AI in retail has long been the holy grail of E-commerce and brick-and-mortar
optimization. However long it takes for true personalization to occur in
retail marketing and advertising, each year AI becomes more important in the
retail industry.

According to some analysts, AI will boost profitability in retail and
wholesale by nearly 60% by 2035!

According to Retail Dive, retail spending on AI will reach $7.3 Billion by
2022.

Think about it though, Retail as an industry is expected to top [$3.8 Trillion
in 2019, according to the NRF](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-retail-
outlook/u-s-retail-sales-expected-to-top-3-8-trillion-in-2019-nrf-
idUSKCN1PU1YM).

#### Retail AI is still a Product thatâs Immature

Even with all this hype, in 2019 AI is still really not likely moving the
needle for retailers as much as one might think. Brands know that
relationships matter. Advertising on Instagram is still trending.

However AmazonGo-like stores are coming, and they will generally usher out the
age of the cashier, and slowly but surely retail sales agents as well. This
really is thanks to AI, deep learning, LiDAR, facial recognition and computer
vision, among other things.

In a study released in early 2019 by IBM at the National Retail Federationâs
big show in New York, IBM identified the following six ways the retail
industry plans on utilizing AI, based on respondentsâ feedback:

  1. Supply chain planning (85%)
  2. Demand forecasting (85%)
  3. Customer intelligence (79%)
  4. Marketing, advertising, and campaign management (75%)
  5. Store operations (73%)
  6. Pricing and promotion (73%)

  * AI is impacting the retail industry across the board, but especially in logistics and business intelligence.

### Retail is worth $3.8 Trillion in 2019

U.S. retail sales are expected to rise between 3.8 percent and 4.4 percent to
more than $3.8 trillion in 2019.

Meanwhile trends like buying online and picking up in store (BOPIS) are really
catching on with brands like Costco, Walmart and so forth. E-commerce
penetration in China and India means their retail sectors are prone to super-
apps that are truly innovative for customer centric convenience.

In the U.S. we are bloated with physical retail. Yet in recent years even the
likes of Alibaba, Amazon and JD.com are hitting brick-and-mortar stores with a
new level of AI and machine intelligence. Retail experiences are changing due
to AI each and every day. We just donât necessarily âseeâ it.

#### The Retail Apocalypse Just Means Retail is at the Intersection of Human
Activity

Retail is a symbol of how transformative the marketplace can be in human
technology. Think about it, even with more than 6,000 stores slated to close
in 2019, AI will also create new jobs in the retinal industry even as
cashiers, shelf scanners, cleaners and other jobs are automated away by AI and
robots.

The only thing thatâs really a retail apocalypse is how disruptive AI is
becoming in all human activities, and this includes all aspects of consumerism
and capitalism broadly speaking. If you make below $20 an hour and your work
is repetitive, it likely wonât exist in 2030 or 2035. The retail cashier and
sales person might be having their last appearance in the next few decades
ahead.

### The Holy Grail of Retail Personalization

Consumers say that a personalized shopping experience can inspire loyalty and
increases in spending. AI is augmenting and enhancing our retail experiences.
This is why things like advertising for brands on Amazon also have such an
incredible future, even as Googleâs hold on advertising is showing signs of
diminishing.

Itâs business as usual though in retail, brick-and-mortar retailers arenât
meeting consumersâ in-store personalization expectations. Itâs very hard to
augment the physical store experience. But the impact of VR and AR on retail
is really very minimal. The impact of apps on shopping however is still huge
and might be just getting started.

Some believe with regards to AI in retail that AI will have its biggest impact
on personalization, search and chatbots. Deep learning and machine
intelligence are rather new to retail, and it will take some time to see the
fruits of some of these experiments and innovations.

### The Lure of Real Retail Stores

Consumers still want to shop in stores, they just want to shop in a different
way. AI is helping to facilitate what the new consumer wants and enjoys the
most about the retail experience.

As shoppers move their spending online and foot traffic to malls declines,
legacy retailers have been forced to rethink their strategies and begin to
adopt the winning ways of AI, personalization, and digital experiences that
work and show a proven track record with Millennials and GenZ consumers.

According to a study by Juniper Research, in the coming years retailers will
spend heavily on AI tools that will enable them to differentiate and improve
the services they offer customers. These will include automated marketing
platforms that generate tailored, timely offers, and chatbots that provide
instant customer service.

### Automation & AI Means a Different Life

The truth is however, AI might lead to re imagining the very concept of
shopping, work and human relationships, just as blockchain will help us
rethink how we see money. All this to say that AI integration in retail is an
important step in the 4th industrial revolution and our move to a more
connected Internet-of-Things smart home-smart city scenario. Retail drone and
robot delivery is coming.

AI will enhance the marketplace. These things just tend to take more time than
we assume. AI needs a certain maturation of the Cloud, Point of Sale, Payments
and so many other sub verticals for it to fully manifest. Having smarter
robots and a neural interface instead of clunky smartphones will also help."

I want to place the transformable node to its last transformation(position, rotation, scaling) once the cloud anchor is resolved.

The position would always be the first tap position and not the last localPosition of the transformable node. </p>

<p>I tried logging the local transformation values and found that the localPosition changes back to (0,0,0) once I am done translating the node. </p>

<p>To my understanding ARCore has a hierarchy based node structure. And the transformable node is the child of the cloud anchor and anchors are immutable. So it should have a LocalPosition with respect parent anchor. Why is the localPosition fluctuating when the node is being moved and goes to (0,0,0) at the end of it. Is there anything I have not gone through? Thanks in advance.</p>

Forgive me as I'm new here and unsure if this is the correct place to post my
question.

I've recently been playing with an ESP32 microcontroller running MicroPython (
<https://github.com/micropython/micropython>)

I'm building an aquarium dosage pump which runs on a timer. It has a web front
end and API etc to control the pumps. All working okay. Currently the
configuration for the device is being stored in a JSON file on the
microcontrollers internal memory. I'm struggling with the file a little bit
and need it to act as more of a database.

I've played around with AWS DynamoDB as a noSQL database using boto3 library
for full blown Python however don't seem to be able to find an easy solution
to use something like this with a microcontroller. I've also taken a look at
Azure Storage tables which is another noSQL database, but again no easy way to
use it.

Wondering if anyone has any ideas here?

I know I haven't explained this particularly well, so ask me any questions!

Many thanks!

<li>If there are fewer messages in the queue than you're waiting for then some number less than or equal to the number of messages available will be returned.  In your example, you may get all 6 but you may only get 3 and have to poll again for the rest.</li>
<li>If there are no messages then the polling will wait as long as your timeout is (20 seconds in your case) and return an empty list.</li>
<li>The 10 message version <em>may</em> return all 10 messages but it might not.  As in question 1, keep reading to get them all.</li>

<p>What I have seen is that if you had 100 messages then you're much more likely to get them all but it's still no guarantee.</p>

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence

 **Artificial intelligence (AI)** , the ability of a digital computer or
Computer controlled Robot to perform tasks commonly associated with
intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of
developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of
humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn
from past experience. Since the development of the Computer in the 1940s , it
has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very
complex tasks with great proficiency. On the other hand, some programs have
attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in
performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this
limited sense is found in applications as diverse as Medical diagnosis ,
Computer Search Engines and Voice or Handwriting recognition.

Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of
intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving,
[perception](https://www.britannica.com/topic/perception), and using language.

LEARNING
There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial
intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error.

REASONING
To reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation. Inferences are
classified as either deductive or inductive.

PROBLEM SOLVING
Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence, may be characterized
as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach
some predefined goal or solution.

PERCEPTION
In perception the environment is scanned by means of various sensory organs,
real or artificial, and the scene is decomposed into separate objects in
various spatial relationships.

LANGUAGE
A language is a system of signs having meaning by convention. In this sense,
language need not be confined to the spoken word.

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence

 **âArtificial Intelligenceâ is a word that seems to be often overused. What
do you think about it?**

We avoid it usually, anybody who does the math usually calls it machine
learning or statistics. Itâs just a public moniker which has been used for
talking about machine learning techniques and what has been happening in the
last couple of years. You can usually substitute âmachine learningâ for
âartificial intelligenceâ in our communication.

 **How would you define Artificial Intelligence?**

AI is a technical system that acts with a certain degree of autonomy. Thatâs
enough justification for using the term.

 **When combining robots and Artificial Intelligence, should we be afraid of
these machines?**

We probably need to be more afraid of humans, for the foreseeable time, than
we need to be afraid of machines. The mere fact that they are getting smarter
doesnât mean they are getting more evil. There is enough evil in humans
already, so itâs probably worth being more afraid of humans for a considerable
while.

The new quality is that we havenât seen this: Itâs not only robots, but its
self-driving cars and many machines are also being âsmartenedâ up now. Your
radio starts talking to you now; there is Alexa making statements while youâre
on the phone. All these things are new, and of course, our natural reaction is
to be slightly worried. However, thereâs going to be a lot more evil in humans
than in machines for a long time.

 **Why do you think people are afraid of machines? Why do we have those
dystopian pictures in our head of machines destroying us?**

First of all, itâs a pop cultural trope which is very established, and as a
metaphor, it works well. Like in âTerminatorâ, for example, there is some kind
of prejudice that there are intelligent systems that are carbon-based, and
thatâs âusâ, and there are the other intelligences which are silicon-based,
and thatâs âthese guysâ. And Iâm not so convinced.

With a bit of historical perspective, what we perceive as âhuman,â which is a
normative term, isnât identical with something having an ape-shaped body or
being Homo Sapiens. Itâs something that goes beyond that. There are values
attached that can just as well be attached to A.I. And the human is drifting.
What we perceive as normal human behaviour: how we think, how we organise our
knowledge, how we interact with technology, has been continually changing for
hundreds of years. Just 15 years ago, when you were supposed to know
something, you actually needed to learn it by heart and have it in your brain.
Now we have Wikipedia and a device in our hands to look everything up. For
somebody 200 years ago this would have been weird and super science-fiction,
to us this merging of human knowledge and machine capacity for storing stuff
feels completely human and normal. I believe we will see more of that process
and slowly blend technology into the human further without us even noticing.
And whatâs good and evil, and who the good guys and the bad guys are, will be
a lot less about what type of body you have, and more about: Who is this guy,
what values do we share and what experiences do we share.

 **Do you think that something like merging machines with humans beings is
something thatâs possible?**

To a degree, this happened already. Us using smartphones and being connected
to all of the human knowledge is a great example. This is always there now,
and this is a large part of what used to be called intelligence which we now
have outsourced to the internet. We no longer do math in our heads; we even
have voice interfaces for machines that do it. We used to be the only ones
that could play Chess or Go or Starcraft; now this is something that A.I. can
do.

Many more of these things will be outsourced, and eventually, there is a
scenario where we just dissolve into a larger technological playing field
where there is some human in all of it left, which is the heritage that we
bring to it: the way we perceive things, our poetry, I hope, will survive:
things like that. Itâs not necessarily my type of body. That wonât be that
terribly important.

 **Do you think this is a good development or is it something that we should
stop?**

Itâs just something that happens, like traffic. Is traffic a good thing or a
bad thing? Itâs a constellation of vectors and factors that interact and have
been going on for a long time and will be going on for a long time. Weâre just
in the middle of it, and this is both fascinating and scary. The best thing we
can do is be very aware of whatâs going on. What we should probably do is look
at these developments and say okay: how can we do good while this is going on,
how can we modulate things that are important to us onto this vast, very old,
super abstract and super powerful process, which you can call rationalization,
or intelligence automation, or deterritorialization, thatâs essentially all
the same: modernity happening to the planet, not really driven by humansâ¦
potentially driven by capital â an abstract force that wants this to happen.
And weâre riding this machine."

Former Prime Minister David Cameron has been hired by a US artificial
intelligence company.

Mr Cameron, who quit UK politics in the wake of the 2016 EU Referendum, will
lead Afiniti's advisory board.

The firm said his ""experience of political leadership through periods of
complexity"" would be invaluable.

Mr Cameron has kept a relatively low profile since leaving UK politics - his
autobiography is due to be published in September.

He is also president of Alzheimer's Research UK and chairs the board of
patrons at National Citizen Service. In 2017 he [took charge of a UK-
government backed investment
initiative](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42377177) between Britain and China.

Mr Cameron said he was ""delighted"" to take on the role ""helping support their
work to transform the future of customer service and interpersonal
communications"".

His former coalition partner - ex-Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg - was
[hired by Facebook](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45913587) as its
head of global affairs and communications last year.

__label__Cloud	"<h1>The Issue</h1>

<p>Hello, I've been trying to capture a point cloud across multiple frames. However when visualizing the data the points seem to be slightly offset or extruded in some way.</p>

<p>Here's what the point cloud data looks like from the final frame (Point size increased for visibility)</p>

<p><a href=""https://gyazo.com/7b78fa39d20372ff65c75ed7a6860b1c.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Last frame</a></p>

<p>However when I try to capture the data across multiple frames, the data seems to get closer to the camera / extude upwards?</p>

<p>Here's the same object but point cloud stored across multiple frames</p>

<p><a href=""https://gyazo.com/7cc1e3a7d822f0142f5b2eb8d960e41d.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Multiple frames</a></p>

<p>And finally here's a side by side comparison of the last frame and multiple frames (Points drawn to scale)</p>

<p><a href=""https://gyazo.com/9c450efb5c780fe70b4c64b9be61b2d5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Side by side</a></p>

<p>I'd expect there to be some more noise but I'm not sure why the data seems to get closer the camera when there is nothing above the object to track.</p>

<h1>Things I've tried</h1>

<p>I thought initially I would perhaps need to transform the points by the pose of the last frame however after a few combinations of pose.compose and pose.inverse() it just seemed to make matters worse (The point cloud looked nothing like the original shape)</p>

<h1>My Code</h1>

<p>Here's how I'm acquiring the point cloud</p>

<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;PointCloud&gt; PointClouds = new ArrayList();
int limit = 100;
int count = 0;

private void onUpdateFrame(FrameTime frameTime)
{
   Frame frame = sceneView.getArFrame();

   if(frame != null)
   {
     if(count &lt; limit)
     {
       PointClouds.add(frame.acquirePointCloud());
     }
     else
     {
       SavePointClouds();
     }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this is how I'm saving the data (Minus the Android file stuff)</p>

<pre><code>private void SavePointClouds()
{
    ArrayList&lt;Vector3&gt; Points = GetPointCloudData();

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    for (Vector3 point :Points)
    {
       sb.append(point.x);
       sb.append("","");
       sb.append(point.y);
       sb.append("","");
       sb.append(point.z);
       sb.append(""\n"");
    }

    //This string is then written to the file
}

private ArrayList&lt;Vector3&gt; GetPointCloudData()
{
    ArrayList&lt;Vector3&gt; Data = new ArrayList();

    for(PointCloud pointCloud : PointClouds)
    {
       FloatBuffer points = pointCloud.getPoints();
       while (points.hasRemaining())
       {
         float x = points.get();
         float y = points.get();
         float z = points.get();
         float confidence = points.get();
         Data.add(new Vector3(x,y,z));
       }
    }

    return Data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The saved file is then opened in <a href=""https://www.danielgm.net/cc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CloudCompare</a> to visualize the data.</p>

__label__Cloud	"Hi,



I am looking for an RMM platform for our network. The main things i want it
for is performance alerting, monitoring (including scriptable), and patch
management.



We are not a huge network, only looking at 50-100 endpoints and i know i can
achieve all these things with different inbuilt tools and GPOs but using a
platform to hande it all is much easier.



I was looking at Pulseway, but it looks like you need to go into each
endpoints console to setup monitoring alerts etc which is pretty cumbersome
and defeats the purpose.

I have been using Itarian for some workstations patching in a trial and it
seems to be working ok, but being free and potential lack of support has be
hesitant in committing to it for our DC.





Thanks

__label__AI	"This week, I interviewed [Yuval Noah
Harari,](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-yuval-noah-
harari-tristan-harris/) the author of three best-selling books about the
history and future of our species, and [Fei-Fei
Li](https://www.wired.com/story/fei-fei-li-artificial-intelligence-humanity/),
one of the pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence. The event was
hosted by the [Stanford Center for Ethics and
Society](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/), [the Stanford Institute for
Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence](https://hai.stanford.edu/), and the
[Stanford Humanities Center](http://shc.stanford.edu/). A transcript of the
event follows, and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4rBh6DBHyw) is
posted below.

 **Nicholas Thompson:** Thank you, Stanford, for inviting us all here. I want
this conversation to have three parts: First, lay out where we are; then talk
about some of the choices we have to make now; and last, talk about some
advice for all the wonderful people in the hall.

Yuval, the [last time we talked](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-
intelligence-yuval-noah-harari-tristan-harris/), you said many, many brilliant
things, but one that stuck out was a line where you said, âWe are not just in
a technological crisis. We are in a philosophical crisis.â So explain what you
meant and explain how it ties to AI. Let's get going with a note of
existential angst.

 **Yuval Noah Harari** : Yeah, so I think what's happening now is that the
philosophical framework of the modern world that was established in the 17th
and 18th century, around ideas like human agency and individual free will, are
being challenged like never before. Not by philosophical ideas, but by
practical technologies. And we see more and more questions, which used to be
the bread and butter of the philosophy department being moved to the
engineering department. And that's scary, partly because unlike philosophers
who are extremely patient people, they can discuss something for thousands of
years without reaching any agreement and they're fine with that, the engineers
won't wait. And even if the engineers are willing to wait, the investors
behind the engineers won't wait. So it means that we don't have a lot of time.
And in order to encapsulate what the crisis is,maybe I can try and formulate
an equation to explain what's happening. And the equation is: B times C times
D equals HH, which means biological knowledge multiplied by computing power,
multiplied by data equals the ability to hack humans. And the AI revolution or
crisis is not just AI, it's also biology. It's biotech. There is a lot of hype
now around AI and computers, but that is just half the story. The other half
is the biological knowledge coming from brain science and biology. And once
you link that to AI, what you get is the ability to hack humans. And maybe
Iâll explain what it means, the ability to hack humans: to create an algorithm
that understands me better than I understand myself, and can therefore
manipulate me, enhance me, or replace me. And this is something that our
philosophical baggage and all our belief in, you know, human agency and free
will, and the customer is always right, and the voter knows best, it just
falls apart once you have this kind of ability.

 **NT:** Once you have this kind of ability, and it's used to manipulate or
replace you, not if it's used to enhance you?

 **YNH:** Also when itâs used to enhance you, the question is, who decides
what is a good enhancement and what is a bad enhancement? So our immediately,
our immediate fallback position is to fall back on the traditional humanist
ideas, that the customer is always right, the customers will choose the
enhancement. Or the voter is always right, the voters will vote, there will be
a political decision about the enhancement. Or if it feels good, do it. Weâll
just follow our heart, weâll just listen to ourselves. None of this works when
there is a technology to hack humans on a large scale. You can't trust your
feelings, or the voters, or the customers on that. The easiest people to
manipulate are the people who believe in free will, because they think they
cannot be manipulated. So how do you how do you decide what to enhance if, and
this is a very deep ethical and philosophical questionâagain that philosophers
have been debating for thousands of yearsâwhat is good? What are the good
qualities we need to enhance? So if you can't trust the customer, if you can't
trust the voter, if you can't trust your feelings, who do you trust? What do
you go by?

 **NT:** All right, Fei-Fei, you have a PhD, you have a CS degree, youâre a
professor at Stanford, does B times C times D equals HH? Is Yuvalâs theory the
right way to look at where we're headed?

 **Fei-Fei Li:** Wow. What a beginning! Thank you, Yuval. One of the
thingsâI've been reading Yuvalâs books for the past couple of years and
talking to youâand I'm very envious of philosophers now because they can
propose questions but they don't have to answer them. Now as an engineer and
scientist, I feel like we have to now [solve the
crisis](https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-kai-fu-lee-fei-fei-li-artificial-
intelligence/). And I'm very thankful that Yuval, among other people, have
opened up this really important question for us. When you said the AI crisis,
I was sitting there thinking, this is a field I loved and feel passionate
about and researched for 20 years, and that was just a scientific curiosity of
a young scientist entering PhD in AI. What happened that 20 years later it has
become a crisis? And it actually speaks of the evolution of AI that, that got
me [where I am today](https://www.wired.com/story/fei-fei-li-ai-care-more-
about-humans/) and got my colleagues at Stanford where we are today with
Human-Centered AI, is that this is a transformative technology. It's a nascent
technology. It's still a budding science compared to physics, chemistry,
biology, but with the power of data, computing, and the kind of diverse impact
AI is making, it is, like you said, is touching human lives and business in
broad and deep ways. And responding to those kinds of questions and crisis
that's facing humanity, I think one of the proposed solutions, that Stanford
is making an effort about is, can we reframe the education, the research and
the dialog of AI and technology in general in a [human-centered
way](https://www.wired.com/story/fei-fei-li-artificial-intelligence-
humanity/)? We're not necessarily going to find a solution today, but can we
involve the humanists, the philosophers, the historians, the political
scientists, the economists, the ethicists, the legal scholars, the
neuroscientists, the psychologists, and many more other disciplines into the
study and development of AI in the next chapter, in the next phase.

the equation is: B times C times D equals HH, which means biological knowledge

humans.""

Yuval Noah Harari

 **NT:** Don't be so certain we're not going to get an answer today. I've got
two of the smartest people in the world glued to their chairs, and I've got 72
more minutes. So let's let's give it a shot.

 **FL:** He said we have thousands of years!

 **NT:** Let me go a little bit further on Yuvalâs opening statement. There
are a lot of crises about AI that people talk about, right? They talk about AI
becoming conscious and what will that mean. They talk about [job
displacement](https://www.wired.com/story/robots-will-take-jobs-from-men-
young-minorities/); they talk about [biases.](https://www.wired.com/story/the-
real-reason-tech-struggles-with-algorithmic-bias/) And Yuval has very clearly
laid out what he thinks is the most important one, which is the combination of
biology plus computing plus data leading to hacking. Is that specific concern
what people who are thinking about AI should be focused on?

 **FL:** Absolutely. So any technology humanity has created starting with fire
is a double-edged sword. So it can bring improvements to life, to work, and to
society, but it can bring the perils, and AI has the perils. You know, I wake
up every day worried about the [diversity, inclusion issue in
AI](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/melinda-gates-and-fei-fei-li-want-to-
liberate-ai-from-guys-with-hoodies/). We worry about fairness or the lack of
fairness, privacy, the labor market. So absolutely we need to be concerned and
because of that, we need to expand the research, and the development of
policies and the dialog of AI beyond just the codes and the products into
these human rooms, into the societal issues. So I absolutely agree with you on
that, that this is the moment to open the dialog, to open the research in
those issues.

 **NT:** Okay.

 **YNH:** Even though I will just say that again, part of my fear is the
dialog. I don't fear AI experts talking with philosophers, I'm fine with that.
Historians, good. Literary critics, wonderful. I fear the moment you start
talking with biologists. That's my biggest fear. When you and the biologists
realize, âHey, we actually have a common language. And we can do things
together.â And that's when the really scary things, I thinkâ¦

 **FL:** Can you elaborate on what is scaring you? That we talk to biologists?

 **YNH:** That's the moment when you can really hack human beings, not by
collecting data about our search words or our purchasing habits, or where do
we go about town, but you can actually start peering inside, and collect data
directly from our hearts and from our brains.

 **FL:** Okay, can I be specific? First of all the birth of AI is AI
scientists talking to biologists, [specifically
neuroscientists](https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-
principle-artificial-intelligence/), right. The birth of AI is very much
inspired by what the brain does. Fast forward to 60 years later, today's AI is
making great [improvements in healthcare](https://www.wired.com/story/health-
care-is-hemorrhaging-data-ai-is-here-to-help/). There's a lot of data from our
physiology and pathology being collected and using machine learning to help
us. But I feel like you're talking about something else.

 **YNH:** That's part of it. I mean, if there wasn't a great promise in the
technology, there would also be no danger because nobody would go along that
path. I mean, obviously, there are enormously beneficial things that AI can do
for us, especially when it is linked with biology. We are about to get the
best healthcare in the world, in history, and the cheapest and available for
billions of people by their smartphones. And this is why it is almost
impossible to resist the temptation. And with all the [issues of
privacy](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-personal-data-collection/),
if you have a big battle between privacy and health, health is likely to win
hands down. So I fully agree with that. And you know, my job as a historian,
as a philosopher, as a social critic is to point out the dangers in that.
Because, especially in Silicon Valley, people are very much familiar with the
advantages, but they don't like to think so much about the dangers. And the
big danger is what happens when you can hack the brain and that can serve not
just your healthcare provider, that can serve so many things for a crazy
dictator.

 **NT:** Let's focus on what it means to hack the brain. Right now, in some
ways my brain is hacked, right? There's an allure of this device, it wants me
to check it constantly, like my brain has been a little bit hacked. Yours
hasn't because you meditate two hours a day, but mine has and probably most of
these people have. But what exactly is the future brain hacking going to be
that it isn't today?

 **YNH:** Much more of the same, but on a much larger scale. I mean, the point
when, for example, more and more of your personal decisions in life are being
outsourced to an algorithm that is just so much better than you. So you know,
you have we have two distinct dystopias that kind of mesh together. We have
the dystopia of surveillance capitalism, in which there is no like Big Brother
dictator, but more and more of your decisions are being made by an algorithm.
And it's not just decisions about what to eat or where to shop, but decisions
like where to work and where to study, and whom to date and whom to marry and
whom to vote for. It's the same logic. And I would be curious to hear if you
think that there is anything in humans which is by definition unhackable. That
we can't reach a point when the algorithm can make that decision better than
me. So that's one line of dystopia, which is a bit more familiar in this part
of the world. And then you have the full fledged [dystopia of a totalitarian
regime](https://www.wired.com/story/mortal-danger-chinas-push-into-ai/) based
on a total surveillance system. Something like the totalitarian regimes that
we have seen in the 20th century, but augmented with biometric sensors and the
ability to basically track each and every individual 24 hours a day.

And you know, which in the days of Stalin or Hitler was absolutely impossible
because they didn't have the technology, but maybe might be possible in 20
years, 30 years. So, we can choose which dystopia to discuss but they are very
close...

 **NT:** Let's choose the liberal democracy dystopia. Fei-Fei, do you want to
answer Yuvalâs specific question, which is, Is there something in Dystopia A,
liberal democracy dystopia, is there something endemic to humans that cannot
be hacked?

 **FL:** So when you asked me that question, just two minutes ago, the first
word that came to my mind is Love. Is love hackable?

 **YNH:** Ask Tinder, I donât know.

 **FL:** Dating!

 **YNH:** That's a defenseâ¦

 **FL:** Dating is not the entirety of love, I hope.

 **YNH:** But the question is, which kind of love are you referring to? if
you're referring to Greek philosophical love or the loving kindness of
Buddhism, that's one question, which I think is much more complicated. If you
are referring to the biological, mammalian courtship rituals, then I think
yes. I mean, why not? Why is it different from anything else that is happening
in the body?

 **FL:** But humans are humans because we'reâthere's some part of us that is
beyond the mammalian courtship, right? Is that part hackable?

 **YNH:** So that's the question. I mean, you know, in most science fiction
books and movies, they give your answer. When the extraterrestrial evil robots
are about to conquer planet Earth, and nothing can resist them, resistance is
futile, at the very last moment, humans win because the robots donât
understand love.

 **FL:** The last moment is one heroic white dude that saves us. But okay so
the two dystopias, I do not have answers to the two dystopias. But what I want
to keep saying is, this is precisely why this is the moment that we need to
seek for solutions. This is precisely why this is the moment that we believe
the new chapter of AI needs to be written by cross-pollinating efforts from
humanists, social scientists, to business leaders, to civil society, to
governments, to come at the same table to have that multilateral and
cooperative conversation. I think you really bring out the urgency and the
importance and the scale of this potential crisis. But I think, in the face of
that, we need to act.

> ""The easiest people to manipulate are the people who believe in free will,
because they think they cannot be manipulated.""

Yuval Noah Harari

 **YNH:** Yeah, and I agree that we need cooperation that we need much closer
cooperation between engineers and philosophers or engineers and historians.
And also from a philosophical perspective, I think there is something
wonderful about engineers, philosophicallyâ

 **FL:** Thank you!

 **YNH:** â that they really cut the bullshit. I mean, philosophers can talk
and talk, you know, in cloudy and flowery metaphors, and then the engineers
can really focus the question. Like I just had a discussion the other day with
an engineer from Google about this, and he said, âOkay, I know how to maximize
people's time on the website. If somebody comes to me and tells me, âLook,
your job is to maximize time on this application.â I know how to do it because
I know how to measure it. But if somebody comes along and tells me, âWell, you
need to maximize human flourishing, or you need to maximize universal love.â I
don't know what it means.â So the engineers go back to the philosophers and
ask them, âWhat do you actually mean?â Which, you know, a lot of philosophical
theories collapse around that, because they can't really explain thatâand we
need this kind of collaboration.

 **FL:** Yeah. We need an equation for that.

 **NT:** But Yuval, is Fei-Fei right? If we can't explain and we can't code
love, can artificial intelligence ever recreate it, or is it something
intrinsic to humans that the machines will never emulate?

 **YNH:** I don't think that machines will feel love. But you don't
necessarily need to feel it, in order to be able to hack it, to monitor it, to
predict it, to manipulate it. So machines donât like to play Candy Crush, but
they can stillâ

 **NT:** So you think this device, in some future where it's infinitely more
powerful than it is right now, it could make me fall in love with somebody in
the audience?

 **YNH:** That goes to the question of consciousness and mind, and I don't
think that we have the understanding of what consciousness is to answer the
question whether a non-organic consciousness is possible or is not possible, I
think we just don't know. But again, the bar for hacking humans is much lower.
The machines don't need to have consciousness of their own in order to predict
our choices and manipulate our choices. If you accept that something like love
is in the end and biological process in the body, if you think that AI can
provide us with wonderful healthcare, by being able to monitor and predict
something like the flu, or something like cancer, what's the essential
difference between flu and love? In the sense of is this biological, and this
is something else, which is so separated from the biological reality of the
body, that even if we have a machine that is capable of monitoring or
predicting flu, it still lacks something essential in order to do the same
thing with love.

 **FL:** So I want to make two comments and this is where my engineering, you
know, personally speaking, weâre making two very important assumptions in this
part of the conversation. One is that AI is so omnipotent, that it's achieved
to a state that it's beyond predicting anything physical, it's getting to the
consciousness level, itâs getting to even the ultimate love level of
capability. And I do want to make sure that we recognize that we're very,
very, very [far from that](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-teach-
artificial-intelligence-common-sense/). This technology is still very nascent.
Part of the concern I have about today's AI is that super-hyping of its
capability. So I'm not saying that that's not a valid question. But I think
that part of this conversation is built upon that assumption that this
technology has become that powerful and I don't even know how many decades we
are from that. Second related assumption, I feel our conversation is being
based on this that we're talking about the world or state of the world that
only that powerful AI exists, or that small group of people who have produced
the powerful AI and is intended to hack humans exists. But in fact, our human
society is so complex, there's so many of us, right? I mean humanity in its
history, have faced so much technology if we left it in the hands of a bad
player alone, without any regulation, multinational collaboration, rules,
laws, moral codes, that technology could have, maybe not hacked humans, but
destroyed humans or hurt humans in massive ways. It has happened, but by and
large, our society in a historical view is moving to a more civilized and
controlled state. So I think it's important to look at that greater society
and bring other players and people into this dialog. So we don't talk like
there's only this omnipotent AI deciding it's gonna hack everything to the
end. And that brings me to your topic that in addition to hacking humans at
that level that you're talking about, there are some very immediate concerns
already: diversity, privacy, labor, legal changes, you know, international
geopolitics. And I think it's, it's critical to to tackle those now.

 **NT:** I love talking to AI researchers, because five years ago, all the AI
researchers were saying _it's much more powerful than you think_. And now
they're like, _it's not as powerful as you think_. Alright, so I'll just let
me askâ

 **FL:** Itâs because five years ago, you had no idea what AI is, now you're
extrapolating too much.

 **NT:** I didn't say it was wrong. I just said it was the thing. I want to go
into what you just said. But before we do that, I want to take one question
here from the audience, because once we move into the second section weâll be
able to answer it. So the question is for Yuval, How can we avoid the
formation of AI powered digital dictatorships? So how do we avoid dystopia
number two, let's enter that. And then let's go, Fei-Fei, into what we can do
right now, not what we can do in the future.

 **YNH:** The key issue is how to regulate the [ownership of
data](https://www.wired.com/story/should-big-tech-own-our-personal-data/).
Because we won't stop research in biology, and we won't stop researching
computer science and AI. So from the three components of biological knowledge,
computing power and data, I think data is is the easiest, and it's also very
difficult, but still the easiest kind to regulate, to protect. Letâs place
some protections there. And there are efforts [now being
made](https://www.wired.com/story/how-gdpr-affects-you/). And they are not
just political efforts, but you know, also philosophical efforts to really
conceptualize, What does it mean to own data or to regulate the ownership of
data? Because we have a fairly good understanding of what it means to own
land. We had thousands of years of experience with that. We have a very poor
understanding of what it what it actually means to own data and how to
regulate it. But this is the very important front that we need to focus on in
order to prevent the worst dystopian outcomes.

And I agree that AI is not nearly as powerful as some people imagine. But this
is why I think we need to place the bar low, to reach a critical threshold. We
don't need the AI to know us perfectly, which will never happen. We just need
the AI to know us better than we know ourselves, which is not so difficult
because most people don't know themselves very well and often make huge
mistakes in critical decisions. So whether it's finance or career or love
life, to have this shifting authority from humans to algorithm, they can still
be terrible. But as long as they are a bit less terrible than us, the
authority will shift to them.

 **NT:** In your book, you tell a very illuminating story about your own self
and your own coming to terms with who you are and how you could be
manipulated. Will you tell that story here about coming to terms with your
sexuality and the story you told about Coca-Cola in your book? Because I think
that will make it clear what you mean here very well.

 **YNH:** Yes. So I I said, I only realized that I was gay when I was 21. And
I look back at the time and I was I don't know 15, 17 and it should have been
so obvious. It's not like Iâm a stranger. I'm with myself 24 hours a day. And
I just don't notice any of like the screaming signs that are saying, âYou are
gay.â And I don't know how, but the fact is, I missed it. Now in AI, even a
very stupid AI today, will not miss it.

 **FL:** Iâm not so sure!

 **YNH:** So imagine, this is not like a science fiction scenario of a century
from now, this can happen today that you can write all kinds of algorithms
that, you know, they're not perfect, but they are still better, say, than the
average teenager. And what does it mean to live in a world in which you learn
about something so important about yourself from an algorithm? What does it
mean, what happens if the algorithm doesn't share the information with you,
but it shares the information with advertisers? Or with governments? So if you
want to, and I think we should, go down from the cloud, the heights, of you
know, the extreme scenarios, to the practicalities of day-to-day life. This is
a good example, because this is already happening.

 **NT:** Well, let's take the elevator down to the more conceptual level.
Let's talk about what we can do today, as we think about the risks of AI, the
benefits of AI, and tell us you know, sort of your your punch list of what you
think the most important things we should be thinking about with AI are.

 **FL:** Oh boy, there's so many things we could do today. And I cannot agree
more with Yuval, that this is such an important topic. Again, I'm gonna try to
speak about all the efforts that have been made at Stanford because I think
this is a good representation of what we believed are so many efforts we can
do. So in human-centered AI, in which this is the overall theme, we believe
that the next chapter of AI should be human-centered, we believe in three
major principles. One principle is to invest in the next generation of AI
technology that reflects more of the kind of human intelligence we would like.
I was just thinking about your comment about as dependence on data and how the
policy and governance of data should emerge in order to regulate and govern
the AI impact. Well, we should be developing technology that can explain AI,
we call it explainable AI, or AI interpretability studies; we should be
focusing on technology that has a more nuanced understanding of human
intelligence. We should be investing in the development of less data-dependent
AI technology, that will take into considerations of intuition, knowledge,
creativity and other forms of human intelligence. So that kind of human
intelligence inspired AI is one of our principles.

The second principle is to, again, welcome in the kind of multidisciplinary
study of AI. Cross-pollinating with economics, with ethics, with law, with
philosophy, with history, cognitive science and so on. Because there is so
much more we need to understand in terms of a social, human, anthropological,
ethical impact. And\ we cannot possibly do this alone as technologists. Some
of us shouldn't even be doing this. Itâs the ethicists, philosophers who
should participate and work with us on these issues. So that's the second
principle. And within this, we work with policymakers. We convene the kind of
dialogs of multilateral stakeholders.

Then the third, last but not least, I think, Nick, you said that at the very
beginning of this conversation, that we need to promote the human-enhancing
and collaborative and argumentative aspect of this technology. You have a
point. Even there, it can become manipulative. But we need to start with that
sense of alertness, understanding, but still promote the kind of benevolent
application and design of this technology. At least, these are the three
principles that Stanfordâs Human-centered AI Institute is based on. And I just
feel very proud, within the short few months since the birth of this
institute, there are more than 200 faculty involved on this campus in this
kind of research, dialog, study, education, and that number is still growing.

 **NT:** Of those three principles, let's start digging into them. So let's go
to number one, explainability, because this is a really interesting debate in
artificial intelligence. So there's some practitioners who say you should have
algorithms that can explain what they did and the choices they made. Sounds
eminently sensible. But how do you do that? I make all kinds of decisions that
I can't entirely explain. Like, why did I hire this person, not that person? I
can tell a story about why I did it. But I don't know for sure. If we don't
know ourselves well enough to always be able to truthfully and fully explain
what we did, how can we expect a computer, using AI, to do that? And if we
demand that here in the West, then there are other parts of the world that
don't demand that who may be able to move faster. So why don't I ask you the
first part of that question, and Yuval all the second part of that question.
So the first part is, can we actually get explainability if it's super hard
even within ourselves?

 **FL:** Well, it's pretty hard for me to multiply two digits, but, you know,
computers can do that. So the fact that something is hard for humans doesn't
mean we shouldn't try to get the machines to do it. Especially, you know,
after all these algorithms are based on very simple mathematical logic.
Granted, we're dealing with neural networks these days that have millions of
nodes and billions of connections. So explainability is actually tough. It's
ongoing research. But I think this is such fertile ground. And it's so
critical when it comes to healthcare decisions, financial decisions, legal
decisions. There's so many scenarios where this technology can be potentially
positively useful, but with that kind of explainable capability, so we've got
to try and I'm pretty confident with a lot of smart minds out there, this is a
crackable thing.

On top of that, I think you have a point that if we have technology that can
explain the decision-making process of algorithms, it makes it harder for it
to manipulate and cheat. Right? It's a technical solution, not the entirety of
the solution, that will contribute to the clarification of what this
technology is doing.

 **YNH:** But because, presumably, the AI makes decisions in a radically
different way than humans, then even if the AI explains its logic, the fear is
it will make absolutely no sense to most humans. Most humans, when they are
asked to explain a decision, they tell a story in a narrative form, which may
or may not reflect what is actually happening within them. In many cases, it
doesn't reflect, it's just a made up rationalization and not the real thing.
Now an AI could be much different than a human in telling me, like I applied
to the bank for loans. And the bank says no. And I asked why not? And the bank
says okay, we will ask our AI. And the AI gives this extremely long
statistical analysis based not on one or two salient feature of my life, but
on 2,517 different data points, which it took into account and gave different
weights. And why did you give this this weight? And why did you give... Oh,
there is another book about that. And most of the data points to a human would
seem completely irrelevant. You applied for a loan on Monday, and not on
Wednesday, and the AI discovered that for whatever reason, it's after the
weekend, whatever, people who apply for loans on a Monday are 0.075 percent
less likely to repay the loan. So it goes into into the equation. And I get
this book of the real explanation. And finally, I get a real explanation. It's
not like sitting with a human banker that just bullshits me.

 **FL:** So are you rooting for AI? Are you saying AI is good in this case?

 **YNH:** In many cases, yes. I mean, I think in many cases, it's two sides of
the coin. I think that in many ways, the AI in this scenario will be an
improvement over the human banker. Because for example, you can really know
what the decision is based on presumably, right, but it's based on something
that I as a human being just cannot grasp. I just don'tâI know how to deal
with simple narrative stories. I didn't give you a loan because you're gay.
That's not good. Or because you didn't repay any of your previous loans. Okay,
I can understand that. But my mind doesn't know what to do with the real
explanation that the AI will give, which is just this crazy statistical thing
â¦

> ""Part of the concern I have about today's AI is that super-hyping of its
capability. Part of this conversation is built upon that assumption that this
technology has become that powerful and I don't even know how many decades we
are from that.""

Fei-Fei Li

 **FL:** So there's two layers to your comment. One is how do you trust and be
able to comprehend AIâs explanation? Second is actually can AI be used to make
humans more trustful or be more trustworthy as humans. The first point, I
agree with you, if AI gives you 2,000 dimensions of potential features with
probability, it's not understandable, but the entire history of science in
human civilization is to be able to communicate the results of science in
better and better ways. Right? Like I just had my annual physical and a whole
bunch of numbers came to my cell phone. And, well, first of all my doctors,
the experts, can help me to explain these numbers. Now even Wikipedia can help
me to explain some of these numbers, but the technological improvements of
explaining these will improve. It's our failure as a technologists if we just
throw 200 or 2,000 dimensions of probability numbers at you.

 **YNH:** But this is the explanation. And I think that the point you raised
is very important. But I see it differently. I think science is getting worse
and worse in explaining its theories and findings to the general public, which
is the reason for things like doubting climate change, and so forth. And it's
not really even the fault of the scientists, because the science is just
getting more and more complicated. And reality is extremely complicated. And
the human mind wasn't adapted to understanding the dynamics of climate change,
or the real reasons for refusing to give somebody a loan. But that's the point
when you have an â and let's put aside the whole question of manipulation and
how can I trust. Let's assume the AI is benign. And let's assume there are no
hidden biases and everything is ok. But still, I can't understand.

 **FL:** But that's why people like Nick, the storyteller, has to explainâ¦
What I'm saying, You're right. It's very complex.

 **NT:** Iâm going to lose my job to a computer like next week, but I'm happy
to have your confidence with me!

 **FL:** But that's the job of the society collectively to explain the complex
science. I'm not saying we're doing a great job at all. But I'm saying there
is hope if we try.

 **YNH:** But my fear is that we just really can't do it. Because the human
mind is not built for dealing with these kinds of explanations and
technologies. And it's true for, I mean, it's true for the individual customer
who goes to the bank and the bank refused to give them a loan. And it can even
be on the level, I mean, how many people today on earth understand the
financial system? How many presidents and prime ministers understand the
financial system?

 **NT:** In this country, it's zero.

 **YNH:** So what does it mean to live in a society where the people who are
supposed to be running the businessâ¦ And again, it's not the fault of a
particular politician, it's just the financial system has become so
complicated. And I don't think that economists are trying on purpose to hide
something from the general public. It's just extremely complicated. You have
some of the wisest people in the world, going to the finance industry, and
creating these enormously complex models and tools, which objectively you just
can't explain to most people, unless first of all, they study economics and
mathematics for 10 years or whatever. So I think this is a real crisis. And
this is again, this is part of the philosophical crisis we started with. And
the undermining of human agency. That's part of what's happening, that we have
these extremely intelligent tools that are able to make perhaps better
decisions about our healthcare, about our financial system, but we can't
understand what they are doing and why they're doing it. And this undermines
our autonomy and our authority. And we don't know as a society how to deal
with that.

 **NT:** Ideally, Fei-Feiâs institute will help that. But before we leave this
topic, I want to move to a very closely related question, which I think is one
of the most interesting, which is the question of bias in algorithms, which is
something you've spoken eloquently about. And let's start with the financial
system. So you can imagine an algorithm used by a bank to determine whether
somebody should get a loan. And you can imagine training it on historical data
and historical data is racist. And we don't want that. So let's figure out how
to make sure the data isn't racist, and that it gives loans to people
regardless of race. And we probably all, everybody in this room agrees that
that is a good outcome.

But let's say that analyzing the historical data suggests that women are more
likely to repay their loans than men. Do we strip that out? Or do we allow
that to stay in? If you allow it to stay in, you get a slightly more efficient
financial system? If you strip it out, you have a little more equality before
between men and women. How do you make decisions about what biases you want to
strip and which ones are okay to keep?

 **FL:** Yeah, that's an excellent question, Nick. I mean, I'm not going to
have the answers personally, but I think you touch on the really important
question, which is, first of all, machine learning system bias is a real
thing. You know, like you said, it starts with data, it probably starts with
the very moment we're collecting data and the type of data weâre collecting
all the way through the whole pipeline, and then all the way to the
application. But biases come in very complex ways. At Stanford, we have
machine learning scientists studying the technical solutions of bias, like,
you know, de-biasing data or normalizing certain decision making. But we also
have humanists debating about what is bias, what is fairness, when is bias
good, when is bias bad? So I think you just opened up a perfect topic for
research and debate and conversation in this in this topic. And I also want to
point out that you've already used a very closely related example, a machine
learning algorithm has a potential to actually expose bias. Right? You know,
one of my favorite studies was a paper a couple of years ago analyzing
Hollywood movies and using a machine learning face-recognition algorithm,
which is a very [controversial technology these
days](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-facial-recognition-congress-bias-law-
enforcement/), to recognize Hollywood systematically gives more screen time to
male actors than female actors. No human being can sit there and count all the
frames of faces and whether there is gender bias and this is a perfect example
of using machine learning to expose. So in general there's a rich set of
issues we should study and again, bring the humanists, bring the ethicist,
bring the legal scholars, bring the gender study experts.

 **NT:** Agreed. Though, standing up for humans, I knew Hollywood was sexist
even before that paper. but yes, agreed.

 **FL:** You're a smart human.

 **NT:** Yuval, on that question of the loans, do you strip out the racist
data, you strip out the gender data? What biases you get rid of what biases do
you not?

 **YNH:** I don't think there is a one size fits all. I mean, it's a question
we, again, we need this day-to-day collaboration between engineers and
ethicists and psychologists and political scientists

 **NT:** But not biologists, right?

 **YNH:** And increasingly, also biologists! And, you know, it goes back to
the question, what should we do? So, we should teach ethics to coders as part
of the curriculum, that the people today in the world that most need a
background in ethics, are the people in the computer science departments. So
it should be an integral part of the curriculum. And also in the big
corporations, which are designing these tools, should be embedded within the
teams, people with backgrounds in things like ethics, like politics, that they
always think in terms of what biases might we inadvertently be building into
our system? What could be the cultural or political implications of what we're
building? It shouldn't be a kind of afterthought that you create this neat
technical gadget, it goes into the world, something bad happens, and then you
start thinking, âOh, we didn't see this one coming. What do we do now?â From
the very beginning, it should be clear that this is part of the process.

 **FL:** I do want to give a shout out to Rob Reich, who introduced this whole
event. He and my colleagues, Mehran Sahami and a few other Stanford professors
have opened this course called Computers, **Ethics** and Public Policy. This
is exactly the kind of class thatâs needed. I think this quarter the offering
has more than 300 students signed up for that.

> ""We should be focusing on technology that has a more nuanced understanding
of human intelligence.""

Fei-Fei Li

 **NT:** Fantastic. I wish that course has existed when I was a student here.
Let me ask an excellent question from the audience that ties into this. How do
you reconcile the inherent trade-offs between explainability and efficacy and
accuracy of algorithms?

 **FL:** Great question. This question seems to be assuming if you can explain
that you're less good or less accurate?

 **NT:** Well, you can imagine that if you require explainability, you lose
some level of efficiency, you're adding a little bit of complexity to the
algorithm. So, okay, first of all, I don't necessarily believe in that.
There's no mathematical logic to this assumption. Second, let's assume there
is a possibility that an explainable algorithm suffers in efficiency. I think
this is a societal decision we have to make. You know, when we put the
seatbelt in our car driving, that's a little bit of an efficiency loss because
I have to do the seat belt movement instead of just hopping in and driving.
But as a society, we decided we can afford that loss of efficiency because we
care more about human safety. So I think AI is the same kind of technology. As
we make these kind of decisions going forward in our solutions, in our
products, we have to balance human well-being and societal well-being with
efficiency.

 **NT:** So Yuval, let me ask you the global consequences of this. This is
something that a number of people have asked about in different ways and we've
touched on but we haven't hit head on. There are two countries, imagine you
have Country A and you have Country B. Country A says all of you AI engineers,
you have to make it explainable. You have to take ethics classes, you have to
really think about the consequences and what you're doing. You got to have
dinner with biologists, you have to think about love, and you have to like
read John Locke, that's Country A. Country B says, just go build some stuff,
right? These two countries at some point are going to come in conflict, and
I'm going to guess that Country Bâs technology might be ahead of Country Aâs.
Is that a concern?

 **YNH:** Yeah, that's always the concern with arms races, which become a race
to the bottom in the name of efficiency and domination. I mean, what is
extremely problematic or dangerous about the situation now with AI, is that
more and more countries are waking up to the realization that this could be
the technology of domination in the 21st century. So you're not talking about
just any economic competition between the different textile industries or even
between different oil industries, like one country decides to we don't care
about the environment at all, weâll just go full gas ahead and the other
countries are much more environmentally aware. The situation with AI is
potentially much worse, because it could be really the technology of
domination in the 21st century. And those left behind could be dominated,
exploited, conquered by those who forge ahead. So nobody wants to stay behind.
And I think the only way to prevent this kind of catastrophic arms race to the
bottom is greater global cooperation around AI. Now, this sounds utopian
because we are now moving in exactly the opposite direction of more and more
rivalry and competition. But this is part of, I think, of our job, like with
the nuclear arms race, to make people in different countries realize that this
is an arms race, that whoever wins, humanity loses. And it's the same with AI.
If AI becomes an arms race, then this is extremely bad news for all humans.
And it's easy for, say, people in the US to say we are the good guys in this
race, you should be cheering for us. But this is becoming more and more
difficult in a situation when the motto of the day is America First. How can
we trust the USA to be the leader in AI technology, if ultimately it will
serve only American interests and American economic and political domination?
So I think, most people when they think arms race in AI, they think USA versus
China, but there are almost 200 other countries in the world. And most of them
are far, far behind. And when they look at what is happening, they are
increasingly terrified. And for a very good reason.

 **NT:** The historical example you've made is a little unsettling. Because,
if I heard your answer correctly, it's that we need global cooperation. And if
we don't, we're going to need an arms race. In the actual nuclear arms race,
we tried for global cooperation from, I don't know, roughly 1945 to 1950. And
then we gave up and then we said, We're going full throttle in the United
States. And then, Why did the Cold War end the way it did? Who knows but one
argument would be that the United States and its relentless buildup of nuclear
weapons helped to keep the peace until the Soviet Union collapsed. So if that
is the parallel, then what might happen here is weâll try for global
cooperation and 2019, 2020, and 2021 and then weâll be off [in an arms
race.](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-cold-war-china-could-doom-us-all/) A, is
that likely and B, if it is, would you say well, then the US needs to really
move full throttle on AI because it will be better for the liberal democracies
to have artificial intelligence than totalitarian states?

 **YNH:** Well, I'm afraid it is very likely that cooperation will break down
and we will find ourselves in an extreme version of an arms race. And in a way
it's worse than the nuclear arms race because with nukes, at least until
today, countries developed them, but never use them. AI will be used all the
time. It's not something you have on the shelf for some Doomsday war. It will
be used all the time to create potentially total surveillance regimes and
extreme totalitarian systems, in one way or the other. And so, from this
perspective, I think the danger is far greater. You could say that the nuclear
arms race actually saved democracy and the free market and, you know, rock and
roll and Woodstock and then the hippies and they all owe a huge debt to
nuclear weapons. Because if nuclear weapons weren't invented, there would have
been a conventional arms race and conventional military buildup between the
Soviet bloc and the American bloc. And that would have meant total
mobilization of society. If the Soviets are having total mobilization, the
only way the Americans can compete is to do the same.

Now what actually happened was that you had an extreme totalitarian mobilized
society in the communist bloc. But thanks to nuclear weapons, you didn't have
to do it in the United States or in Western Germany, or in France, because we
relied on nukes. You don't need millions of conscripts in the army.

And with AI it is going to be just the opposite, that the technology will not
only be developed, it will be used all the time. And that's a very scary
scenario.

 **FL:** Wait, can I just add one thing? I don't know history like you do, but
you said AI is different from nuclear technology. I do want to point out, it
is very different because at the same time as you're talking about these
scarier situations, this technology has a wide international scientific
collaboration that is being used to make transportation better, to improve
healthcare, to improve education. And so it's a very interesting new time that
we haven't seen before because while we have this kind of competition, we also
have massive international scientific community collaboration on these
benevolent uses and democratization of this technology. I just think it's
important to see both sides of this.

 **YNH:** You're absolutely right here. There are some, as I said, there's
also enormous benefits to this technology.

 **FL:** And in a in a globally collaborative way, especially between and
among scientists.

 **YNH:** The global aspect is is more complicated, because the question is,
what happens if there is a huge gap in abilities between some countries and
most of the world? Would we have a rerun of the 19th century Industrial
Revolution when the few industrial powers conquer and dominate and exploit the
entire world, both economically and politically? Whatâs to prevent that from
repeating? So even in terms of, you know, without this scary war scenario, we
might still find ourselves with global exploitation regime, in which the
benefits, most of the benefits, go to a small number of countries at the
expense of everybody else.

 **FL:** So students in the audience will laugh at this but we are in a very
different scientific research climate. The kind of globalization of technology
and technique happens in a way that the 19th century, even the 20th century,
never saw before. Any paper that is a basic science research paper in AI today
or technical technique that is produced, let's say this week at Stanford, it's
easily globally distributed through this thing called arXiv or GitHub
repository orâ

 **YNH:** The information is out there. Yeah.

 **FL:** The globalization of this scientific technology travels in a
different way from the 19th and 20th century. I don't doubt there is confined
development of this technology, maybe by regimes. But we do have to recognize
that this global reach, the differences are pretty sharp now. And we might
need to take that into consideration. That the scenario you're describing is
harder, Iâm not saying impossible, but harder to happen.

 **YNH:** I'll just say that it's not just the scientific papers. Yes, the
scientific papers are there. But if I live in Yemen, or in Nicaragua, or in
Indonesia or in Gaza, yes, I can connect to the internet and download the
paper. What will I do with that? I don't have the data, I don't have the
infrastructure. I mean, you look at where the big corporations are coming
from, that hold all the data of the world, they're basically coming from just
two places. I mean, even Europe is not really in the competition. There is no
European Google, or European Amazon, or European Baidu, of European Tencent.
And if you look beyond Europe, you think about Central America, you think
about most of Africa, the Middle East, much of Southeast Asia, itâs, yes, the
basic scientific knowledge is out there, but this is just one of the
components that go to creating something that can compete with Amazon or with
Tencent, or with the abilities of governments like the US government or like
the Chinese government. So I agree that the dissemination of information and
basic scientific knowledge are in a completely different place than the 19th
century.

 **NT:** Let me ask you about that, because it's something three or four
people have asked in the questions, which is, it seems like there could be a
centralizing force of artificial intelligence that will make whoever has the
data and the best computer more powerful and it could then accentuate income
inequality, both within countries and within the world, right? You can imagine
the countries you've just mentioned, the United States, China, Europe lagging
behind, Canada somewhere behind, way ahead of Central America, it could
accentuate global income inequality. A, do you think that's likely and B, how
much does it worry you?

 **YNH:** As I said, it's very likely it's already happening. And it's
extremely dangerous. Because the economic and political consequences could be
catastrophic. We are talking about the potential collapse of entire economies
and countries, countries that depend on cheap manual labor, and they just
don't have the educational capital to compete in a world of AI. So what are
these countries going to do? I mean, if, say, you shift back most production
from, say, Honduras or Bangladesh to the USA and to Germany, because the human
salaries are no longer part of the equation and it's cheaper to produce the
shirt in California than in Honduras, so what will the people there do? And
you can say, okay, but there will be many more jobs for software engineers.
But we are not teaching the kids in Honduras to be software engineers. So
maybe a few of them could somehow immigrate to the US. But most of them wonât
and what will they do? And we, at present, we don't have the economic answers
and the political answers to these questions.

 **FL:** I think that's fair enough, I think Yuval definitely has laid out
some of the critical pitfalls of this and, and that's why we need more people
to be studying and thinking about this. One of the things we over and over
noticed, even in this process of building the community of human-centered AI
and also talking to people both internally and externally, is that there are
opportunities for businesses around the world and governments around the world
to think about their data and AI strategy. There are still many opportunities
outside of the big players, in terms of companies and countries, to really
come to the realization that it's an important moment for their country, for
their region, for their business, to transform into this digital age. And I
think when you talk about these potential dangers and lack of data in parts of
the world that haven't really caught up with this digital transformation, the
moment is now and we hope to, you know, raise that kind of awareness and
encourage that kind of transformation.

 **YNH:** Yeah, I think it's very urgent. I mean, what we are seeing at the
moment is, on the one hand, what you could call some kind of data
colonization, that the same model that we saw in the 19th century that you
have the imperial hub, where they have the advanced technology, they grow the
cotton in India or Egypt, they send the raw materials to Britain, they produce
the shirts, the high tech industry of the 19th century in Manchester, and they
send the shirts back to sell them in in India and outcompete the local
producers. And we, in a way, might be beginning to see the same thing now with
the data economy, that they harvest the data in places also like Brazil and
Indonesia, but they don't process the data there. The data from Brazil and
Indonesia, goes to California or goes to eastern China being processed there.
They produce the wonderful new gadgets and technologies and sell them back as
finished products to the provinces or to the colonies.

Now it's not a one-to-one. It's not the same, there are differences. But I
think we need to keep this analogy in mind. And another thing that maybe we
need to keep in mind in this respect, I think, is the reemergence of stone
wallsâoriginally my speciality was medieval military history. This is how I
began my academic career with the Crusades and castles and knights and so
forth. And now I'm doing all these cyborgs and AI stuff. But suddenly, there
is something that I know from back then, the walls are coming back. I try to
kind of look at what's happening here. I mean, we have virtual realities. We
have 3G, AI and suddenly the hottest political issue is building a stone wall.
Like the most low-tech thing you can imagine. And what is the significance of
a stone wall in a world of interconnectivity and and all that? And it really
frightens me that there is something very sinister there. The combination of
data is flowing around everywhere so easily, but more and more countries and
also my home country of Israel, it's the same thing. You have the, you know,
the startup nation, and then the wall. And what does it mean this combination?

 **NT:** Fei-Fei, you want to answer that?

 **FL:** Maybe we can look at the next question!

 **NT:** You know what? Let's go to the next question, which is tied to that.
And the next question is: you have the people here at Stanford who will help
build these companies, who will either be furthering the process of data
colonization, or reversing it or who will be building, you know, the efforts
to create a virtual wall and world based on artificial intelligence are being
created, or funded at least by a Stanford graduate. So you have all these
students here in the room, how do you want them to be thinking about
artificial intelligence? And what do you want them to learn? Let's, let's
spend the last 10 minutes of this conversation talking about what everybody
here should be doing.

 **FL:** So if you're a computer science or engineering student, take Rob's
class. If you're humanists take my class. And all of you read Yuvalâs books.

 **NT:** Are his books on your syllabus?

 **FL:** Not on mine. Sorry! I teach hardcore deep learning. His book doesn't
have equations. But seriously, what I meant to say is that Stanford students,
you have a great opportunity. We have a proud history of bringing this
technology to life. Stanford was at the forefront of the birth of AI. In fact,
our Professor John McCarthy coined the term artificial intelligence and came
to Stanford in 1963 and started this nation's, one of the two oldest, AI labs
in this country. And since then, Stanford's AI research has been at the
forefront of every wave of AI changes. And in 2019 we're also at the forefront
of starting the human-centered AI revolution or the writing of the new AI
chapter. And we did all this for the past 60 years for you guys, for the
people who come through the door and who will graduate and become
practitioners, leaders, and part of the civil society and that's really what
the bottom line is about. Human-centered AI needs to be written by the next
generation of technologists who have taken classes like Rob's class, to think
about the ethical implications, the human well being. And it's also going to
be written by those potential future policymakers who came out of Stanfordâs
humanities studies and Business School, who are versed in the details of the
technology, who understand the implications of this technology, and who have
the capability to communicate with the technologists. That is, no matter how
we agree and disagree, that's the bottom line, is that we need this kind of
multilingual leaders and thinkers and practitioners. And that is what
Stanford's Human-centered AI Institute is about.

 **NT:** Yuval, how do you answer that question?

 **YNH:** On the individual level, I think it's important for every individual
whether in Stanford, whether an engineer or not, to get to know yourself
better, because you're now in a competition. It's the oldest advice in all the
books in philosophies is know yourself. We've heard it from Socrates, from
Confucius, from Buddha: get to know yourself. But there is a difference, which
is that now you have competition. In the day of Socrates or Buddha, if you
didn't make the effort, okay, so you missed on enlightenment. But still, the
king wasn't competing with you. They didn't have the technology. Now you have
competition. You're competing against these giant corporations and
governments. If they get to know you better than you know yourself, the game
is over. So you need to buy yourself some time and the first way to buy
yourself some time is to get to know yourself better, and then they have more
ground to cover. For engineers and students, I would sayâI'll focus on it on
engineers maybeâthe two things that I would like to see coming out from the
laboratories and and the engineering departments, is first, tools that
inherently work better in a decentralized system than in a centralized system.
I don't know how to do it. But I hope this is something that engineers can can
work with. I heard that [blockchain](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-
blockchain/) is like the big promise in in that area, I don't know. But
whatever it is, part of when you start designing the tool, part of the
specification of what this tool should be like, I would say, this tool should
work better in a decentralized system than in a centralized system. That's the
best defense of democracy.

 **NT:** I don't want to cut you off, because I want you to get to the second
thing. But how do you make a tool work better in a democracy?

 **YNH:** I'm not an engineer, I don't know.

 **NT:** Okay. Go to part two. Someone in this room, figure that out, because
it's very important.

 **YNH:** And I can give you historical examples of tools that work better in
this way or in that way. But I don't know how to translate it into present day
technology.

 **NT:** Go to part two because I got a few more questions from the audience.

 **YNH:** Okay, so the other thing I would like to see coming is an AI
sidekick that serves me and not some corporation or government. I mean, we
can't stop the progress of this kind of technology, but I would like to see it
serving me. So yes, it can hack me but it hacks me in order to protect me.
Like my computer has an antivirus but by brain hasn't. It has a biological
antivirus against the flu or whatever, but not against hackers and trolls and
so forth. So, one project to work on is to create an AI sidekick, which I paid
for, maybe a lot of money and it belongs to me, and it follows me and it
monitors me and what I do in my interactions, but everything it learns, it
learns in order to protect me from manipulation by other AIs, by other outside
influencers. So this is something that I think with the present day
technology, I would like to see more effort in in the direction.

 **FL:** Not to get into technical terms, but I think you I think you would
feel confident to know that the budding efforts in this kind of research is
happening you know, trustworthy AI, explainable AI, security-motivated or
aware AI. So I'm not saying we have the solution, but a lot of technologists
around the world are thinking along that line and trying to make that happen.

 **YNH:** It's not that I want an AI that belongs to Google or to the
government that I can trust. I want an AI that I'm its master. It's serving
me.

 **NT:** And it's powerful, it's more powerful than my AI because otherwise my
AI could manipulate your AI.

 **YNH:** It will have the inherent advantage of knowing me very well. So it
might not be able to hack you. But because it follows me around and it has
access to everything I do and so forth, it gives it an edge in this specific
realm of just me. So this is a kind of counterbalance to the danger that the
peopleâ

 **FL:** But even that would have a lot of challenges in their society. Who is
accountable, are you accountable for your actions or your sidekick?

 **YNH:** This is going to be a more and more difficult question that we will
have to deal with.

 **NT:** Alright Fei-Fei, let's go through a couple questions quickly. We
often talk about top-down AI from the big companies, how should we design
personal AI to help accelerate our lives and careers? The way I interpret that
question is, so much of AI is being done at the big companies. If you want to
have AI at a small company or personally, can you do that?

 **FL:** So well, first of all, one of the solutions is what Yuval just said.

 **NT:** Probably those things were built by Facebook.

 **FL:** So first of all, it's true, there is a lot of investment and effort
and resource putting big companies in AI research and development, but it's
not that all the AI is happening there. I want to say that academia continues
to play a huge role in AIâs research and development, especially in the long
term exploration of AI. And what is academia? Academia is a worldwide network
of individual students and professors thinking very independently and
creatively about different ideas. So from that point of view, it's a very
grassroots kind of effort in AI research that continues to happen. And small
businesses and independent research Institutes also have a role to play. There
are a lot of publicly available data sets. Itâs a global community that is
very open about sharing and disseminating knowledge and technology. So yes,
please, by all means, we want global participation in this.

 **NT:** All right, here's my favorite question. This is from anonymous,
unfortunately. If I am in eighth grade, do I still need to study?

 **FL:** As a mom, I will tell you yes. Go back to your homework.

 **NT:**. Alright Fei-Fei, What do you want Yuvalâs next book to be about?

 **FL:** Wow, I need to think about that.

 **NT:** Alright. Well, while you think about that, Yuval, what area of
machine learning you want Fei-Fei to pursue next?

 **FL:** The sidekick project.

 **YNH:** Yeah, I mean, just what I said. Can we create the kind of AI which
can serve individual people, and not some kind of big network? I mean, is that
even possible? Or is there something about the nature of AI, which inevitably
will always lead back to some kind of network effect, and winner takes all and
so forth.

 **FL:** Ok, his next book is going to be a science fiction book between you
and your sidekick.

 **NT:** Alright, one last question for Yuval, because we've got the top voted
question. Without the belief in free will, what gets you up in the morning?

 **YNH:** Without the belief in free will? I don't think that's the question â¦
I mean, itâs very interesting, very central, it has been central in Western
civilization because of some kind of basically theological mistake made
thousands of years ago. But really it's a misunderstanding of the human
condition.

The real question is, how do you liberate yourself from suffering? And one of
the most important steps in that direction is to get to know yourself better.
For me, the biggest problem was the belief in free will, is that it makes
people incurious about themselves and about what is really happening inside
themselves because they basically say, âI know everything. I know why I make
decisions, this is my free will.â And they identify with whatever thought or
emotion pops up in their mind because this is my free will. And this makes
them very incurious about what is really happening inside and what is also the
deep sources of the misery in their lives. And so this is what makes me wake
up in the morning, to try and understand myself better to try and understand
the human condition better. And free will is just irrelevant for that.

 **NT:** And if we lose your sidekick and get you up in the morning. Fei-Fei,
75 minutes ago, you said we weren't gonna reach any conclusions Do you think
we got somewhere?

 **FL:** Well, we opened the dialog between the humanist and the technologist
and I want to see more of that.

 **NT:** Great. Thank you so much. Thank you, Fei Fei. Thank you, Yuval.
wonderful to be here.

__label__AI	Ethics Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence - Artificial Intelligence (AI) i https://t.co/xX0LfHo6i6 #ai
__label__AI	"Russian banks are stepping up the use of [artificial
intelligence](https://www.computerweekly.com/ehandbook/A-Computer-Weekly-
buyers-guide-to-automation-and-AI-in-systems-management) (AI) as the
technologyâs unprecedented evolution looks set to see it boost their
competitiveness, but shortages of people with the right skills, as well as
infrastructural issues, are hampering the technologyâs wider applications.

âAI is undergoing a period of unprecedented evolution. Over the next few
years, the technology will progress so far that AI will be employed in
financial institutions just as often as humans,â said [Sergey
Putyatinsky](https://mkb.ru/en/about/corporate-governance/management-
board/putyatinskiy-sergey-evgenevich), deputy chairman of Credit Bank of
Moscow (CBoM)[](https://mkb.ru/en/about/corporate-governance/management-
board/putyatinskiy-sergey-evgenevich). âActive use of AI technology will be a
decisive factor in banksâ competition in mass segments.â

According to a study conducted by the [local rating agency Expert
RA](https://www.raexpert.com/), in cooperation with the Centre for Financial
Technologies, Russian banks most often use AI in credit analysis.

Other areas where AI adoption has been increasing, according to the study, are
debt collection and marketing, including creation of individual [offers for
customers](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252441507/One-fifth-of-global-
banks-think-AI-will-boost-customer-experience).

Meanwhile, the study revealed that Russian banks mostly put their hopes on AI
in such areas as uncovering fraudulent transactions, debt collection and
credit scoring, while automating call centres by [introducing chat
bots](https://searchcrm.techtarget.com/essentialguide/Guide-to-AI-in-customer-
service-using-chatbots-and-NLP), using AI in algorithmic trading, [human
resources (HR)
management](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/podcast/Testing-the-
intelligence-of-AI-in-HR-applications) and remote customer identification are
generally considered less promising.

According to the studyâs authors, however, the latter areas may not
necessarily be dismissed by lenders as unsuitable for AI adoption, but it is
difficult to come up with the returns on investment (ROI) from applying the
technology to those areas. Meanwhile, Russian banks often prefer to adopt the
technology by small steps.

âWe are pragmatic about the adoption of âhypedâ technologies,â said
Putyatinsky. âWe normally start with smaller-scale pilot projects that allow
us to evaluate the potential usefulness of the technology and build up in-
house competences.

âWherever possible, we use open-source software. We make calculations for
every project to determine if it is financially viable and, based on that, we
make decisions on whether to greenlight it.â

According to Putyatinsky, CBoMâs priority areas for AI technology are
processing full-text documents, making loan decisions, dealing with over-due
debts and financial monitoring.

Another major Russian lender, Rosbank, uses AI for processes involving [risk
evaluation](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/feature/AI-in-insurance-
forces-big-changes-to-traditional-industry), loan issuing, optimisation of the
branch network, uncovering fraud, communications and interaction with
customers.

âWe believe that over the next one to two years, AI will also be adopted for
the bankâs other processes that are not directly linked to interaction with
customers,â said [Dmitry Smirnov, head of Rosbankâs data
lab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smirdm/?locale=de_DE).

âAccumulating large amounts of data and the arrival of new data sources will
facilitate that. We are actively exploring areas where AI could be potentially
adopted. These are processes aimed at improving the organisationâs efficiency
and, from the customerâs viewpoint, processes that simplify their interaction
with the bank.â

Meanwhile, Promsvyazbankâs main area for AIâs application includes credit
decision-making, uncovering fraud and forming offers for customers.

âCurrently, we are working on broadening the scope of AI application,â said
Daniil Tkach, head of the customer relations department at
[Promsvyazbank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promsvyazbank).

âIn the short term, automated systems will tell us which products would be the
best offer for a customer, what channels will be the most efficient and what
communication style will be most amenable to the customer.â

According to Tkach, the main conditions for wider spread of AI include a
sufficient degree of automation and manageability, reliable systems for data
collection and a sufficient number of reiterations of processes for learning
purposes. He said this is applicable for just about any banking processes,
such as sales, communications, anti-fraud and operations.

âWe could also single out intellectual management systems, in which AI
substantially helps superiors to understand the quality of work by their
employees and provides tips to all employees for possibly improving their
work,â Tkach said.

Still, Russian banks often see AI as a technology that could help automate new
areas rather than replace already existing automation solutions.

âWe are not trying to revamp existing solutions,â CBoMâs Putyatinsky said.
âInstead, we look at areas that have not yet been automated and start
automating them from scratch with the use of new technology.â

### __Obstacles to AI adoption

Meanwhile, the process of [adopting AI in the banking
sector](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252447328/Barclays-appointment-
will-step-up-use-of-AI-in-investment-bank) is not always smooth. There are
[obstacles in the
way](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252452506/OpenStack-Foundation-will-
tackle-infrastructure-barriers-to-enterprise-AI-adoption) of the technologyâs
wider spread across the industry.

According to the Expert RA study, those obstacles include discrepancies with
data in information systems, but once the issue of data consistency is
resolved, finding qualified personnel to process data is set to be a major
challenge.

Industry insiders have already been complaining about difficulties in finding
qualified personnel to operate AI-based solutions.

âThe main factors that are impeding the adoption and development of AI are
shortages of qualified professionals and problems with the infrastructure of
information systems,â said Smirnov.

Putyatinsky agreed, saying: âThe acutest issue is training of qualified
personnel.â

To help resolve this challenge, CBoM has been running an internship programme
called [IB Universe](https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/artificial-
intelligence-in-banking-industry-conversion-to-genuine-benefits/) for the past
12 months. âThis allows students and recent graduates to acquire practical
experience in various areas of investment business,â added Putyatinsky.

According to Putyatinsky, educational programmes of that kind will eventually
allow banks to train personnel in the working environment, producing a new
wave of employees who will already be prepared to deal with new technologies,
such as AI and machine learning.

Another issue with application of AI is complexity of the technologyâs
algorithms, Promsvyazbankâs Tkach said. âContemporary [machine learning
algorithms](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/answer/How-do-machine-learning-
algorithms-differ-from-traditional-algorithms) are so complex that humans have
problems understanding decisions made by AI,â he added.

Over the next few years, progress with adopting AI systems in Russiaâs banking
industry is set to largely depend on investments in regional networks,
personnel training and banksâ ability to attract and retain customers,
according to the Expert RA study.

âThe good news is that at this point, a bank doesnât need to make enormous
investment to become one of the [Russian banking industryâs] AI leaders,â said
the studyâs authors. âBut the bad news is that to achieve that, you have to
act right now.â

<li><strong>title:</strong> Itâs the bold section of notification.</li>
<li><strong>body:</strong> It represents âMessage textâ field of the Firebase SDK, this is the message you want to send to the users.</li>
</ul>

<p>To find your Sender ID and API key you have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Login to the Firebase Developer Console and go to your Dashboard</li>
<li>Click on the âgearâ icon and access âproject settingsâ </li>
<li>Go to the
âCloud Messaging Sectionâ and you will have access to the sender ID
and the API Key.

__label__AI	"_In episode 3 of Tech Lightning Rounds, Beth Kindig goes directly to the
source of artificial intelligence expertise and hosts discussions with
technologists who specialize in the field. Interviews are held in âlightning
roundâ format, which are rapid interviews with tech experts for immediate
depth on each topic._

Mastercard pioneered the idea of electronic payments, and in many regards, was
the first âfintechâ company in the market. With this follows great
responsibility, especially as the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners
reported a 42% frequency of fraud across small businesses costing an average
of 5% of gross revenues. Mastercard is using artificial intelligence and
natural language processing in unique ways to combat fraud and money
laundering.

In this podcast, Ann Cairns, Executive Vice Chairman of Mastercard discusses
the following ways AI can be used in the financial industry including how to
fight fraud:

  * AI can detect if someone has taken your phone and is using your banking applications as each person holds a phone unique to them including how a person holds their head and makes key strokes.
  * Natural language processing can detect if money is being moved suspiciously and split, or recombined, in unnatural ways. Financial companies, including Mastercard, can light up the movements on a dashboard and track the money as if they were âtracking the spread of a virusâ to help fight fraud.

Cairns also discusses how small shopkeepers in emerging markets can access
capital to grow businesses and the efforts Mastercard is making to create a
more inclusive environment in the financial markets.

**ABOUT MASTERCARD:**

Mastercard has beaten many of the FANG stocks over the last year with a return
of 30% and is currently at $245 per share up from $175 at December lows. MA
can be described as having one foot in the present and one foot in the future.
The business model has done well due to the âdisintermediation of cash/checksâ
and an increase of dominance in the payments eco-system, while also building
out artificial intelligence opportunities and envisioning a future where
credit cards and smartphones are not needed for more seamless payments through
the use biometrics.

Last month, Mastercard topped earnings estimates by reporting $1.78 earnings
per share compared to the consensus of $1.66 EPS. The company had $3.89
billion revenue for the quarter, up 9% from a year-ago quarter. Visa also beat
earnings with an 8% revenue climb to $5.45 billion with $1.31 earnings per
share. Both Mastercard and Visa have been trading at record highs. Recently,
Visa beat Mastercard in a bid to buy Earthport for $320 million. The UK-
company is a pioneer in cross-border payments.

    a. Admin portal where user can create VMs and allocate CPU, memory, GPU for a specific user
    b. User once done can destroy the VM and allocated space return back to the pool
2. Remaining space can be utilized in such a way that - user can be able to schedule run machine learning CPU and GPU bound load. The idea is to train the model in these machines
3. As part of scheduling machine learning load if free space is not available then we should be able to schedule this load to AWS

<p>The register part is used on Cloud Functions. There I call admin.auth().createUser() to set the user credentials for the Auth user as well as for the user document that I add to Cloud Firestore. </p>

<p>My problem is that I hash the password value on the frontend before the HTTP request to Functions is sent. I do this because of safety reasons. But how can I revert the hash, so I can write the raw password into createUser()?</p>

<p>Is there a method to reverse the hash or a method from Firebase Auth to hash the password on the client side and a counterpart to revert it on the server side? </p>

__label__AI	"# 5 Best Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Books in 2019

We have reviewed the top 5 best Artificial Intelligence books available on the
Internet. And to be honest, these books were _really_ hard to find. Between
the âA.I conspiracy booksâ and the âhow to make money off A.I booksâ, there
was really wasnât much left to choose from. These resources are weighted based
off trusted community reviews and the quality of content itself. Because why
waste your time on bad content? You wonât ever truly understand the field of
Artificial Intelligence, nor will you be able to even apply it very well.
These books will cover topics like Machine Learning, Neural Networks,
Mathematical Optimizations, Logic, Probability, and Economics â which are all
_extremely_ useful in todayâs modern world.

### 1\. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach

[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern
Approach](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9332543518/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zeroequalsfal-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=9332543518&linkId=d01c6c70480b5bb97712ea8d4f488ded)
provides AI algorithm techniques in-detail, from pathfinding to intelligent AI
Agent design. If you are looking for one of the best books on A.I, then this
is surely a top pick. There is detailed information on building Agents, graph
algorithms incl. A* Search, and how to navigate in areas of uncertainty. Great
book with lots of content and examples.

### 2\. Deep Learning

[Deep
Learning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262035618/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=zeroequalsfal-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0262035618&linkId=84568d05237b805c578061aed460c18f)
is written by a famous ex-Googler, providing a rich and detailed guide into
one of A.Iâs most exciting sub-fields, âMachine Learningâ. This has to be one
of the best machine learning books out there at the moment. In this book you
will learn about Neural Networks and how to construct them for various use-
cases. Itâs been backed by our industry thought-leaders such as Elon Musk who
has commented on how comphresive this book truly is.

__label__Cloud	"<p>The idea is to either generate an HTTP request directly to firebase via a URL sent in the email, or to do it through React. </p>

<p>You could send them to the URL <code>example.com/verify/USER_DOC_ID</code></p>

<p>Assuming you use <code>react-router-dom</code>, and you want to use the web firebase API to avoid creating an HTTP request, you would do something like the following in your React component (this also assumes you are using firestore in React correctly):</p>

<pre><code>import React, {Component} from 'react':
import firestore from './firestore'; //this is your config file
import {withRouter} from 'react-router-dom';


class Verify extends Component {

    componentDidMount(){
        const {pathname} = this.props.location;
        const ID = pathname.split('/')[2];
        //DO THE FIREBASE UPDATE HERE
     }
     render(){...}


export default withRouter(Verify);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you have a few options for where I placed <code>//DO THE FIREBASE UPDATE HERE</code>. You can either create an http request to firebase, or you can use web side firebase. If you're using web side firebase, you would just update the document in firebase (note that you wouldn't need to import firestore in react if you are doing a fetch request.)</p>

<p>the react way involves something like this:</p>

<pre><code>const ref = firebase.firestore().collection('newsletter').doc(ID);
ref.get().then((doc) =&gt; {
    if(doc.exists()){
        ref.update({verified: true});
  });
</code></pre>

<p>The logic for interacting with firestore is very similar on the backend with the Admin API, however you'll wrap it in an HTTP request in cloud-functions:</p>

<pre><code>exports.verify = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) =&gt; {
  // admin api call with req params or body
});
</code></pre>

<p>With the above code you can either navigate directly here from the email, responding with HTML directly, or you can call it via a fetch request in the react app like <code>fetch(""https://example.com/verify/ID"").then(...)</code>.</p>

<p>If you want more details about any one of the above methods I described, post it as a separate question if you can't find it on SO, let me know, and I'll do my best to answer. </p>

__label__Cloud	"Hello All,



I'm running into a situation that I need to plan for. We have two data
centers...one production and the other fail-over. In our production data
center, we have a about 20 vendors that terminate VPN tunnels on our main
firewall. In the event of a disaster fail-over, we would need to swing those
connections over to the secondary data center. What's the best option of
accomplishing this, without calling each vendor and giving them a new ip to
build their tunnel's to us? Is there a solution where I could have them
terminate to a vpn concentrator that is extracted from on prem? I guess
something like a global load balancer, just with vpn connectivity....

__label__AI	"Humans stand to gain from AI in a number of ways. But AI also has the
potential to replicate or exacerbate long-standing biases. As machine learning
has matured beyond simpler task-based algorithms, it has come to rely more
heavily on deep-learning architectures that pick up on relationships that no
human could see or predict. These algorithms can be extraordinarily powerful,
but they are also âblack boxesâ where the inputs and the outputs may be
visible, but how exactly the two are related is not transparent.

Given their very complexity, bias can creep into the algorithmsâ outputs
without their designers intending it to, or without them even knowing the bias
is there. So perhaps it is unsurprising that many people are wary of the power
vested in machine-learning algorithms.

[Inhi Cho Suh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inhicho/), General Manager, IBM
Watson Customer Engagement, and [Florian
Zettelmeyer](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/zettelmeyer_florian.aspx),
a professor of marketing at Kellogg and chair of the schoolâs marketing
department, are both invested in understanding how deep-learning algorithms
can identify, account for, and reduce bias.

The pair discuss the social and ethical challenges machine learning poses, as
well as the more general question of how developers and companies can go about
building AI that is transparent, fair, and socially responsible. _
_

 _This interview has been edited for length and clarity._

 **Florian ZETTELMEYER:** So, let me kick it off with one example of bias in
algorithms, which is the quality of face recognition. The subjects used to
train the algorithm are vastly more likely to be nonminority than members of
minorities. So as a result of that, the quality of facial recognition turns
out to be better if you happen to look more conventionally Western than if you
have some other ethnicity.

 **Inhi Cho SUH:** Yes, thatâs one example of a bias because of lack of data.
Another really good example of this bias is in loan approval. If you look at
the financial services sector, there are fewer women-owned businesses. So
therefore you may have loans being arbitrarily denied rather than approved
because the lack of sufficient data adds too much uncertainty.

 **ZETTELMEYER:** You donât want to approve a loan unless you have some level
of certainty [in the accuracy of your algorithm], but a lack of data doesnât
allow you to make your statistical inputs good enough.

What do you think of the [Microsoft
bot](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/technology/microsoft-created-a-
twitter-bot-to-learn-from-users-it-quickly-became-a-racist-jerk.html) example
on Twitter [where the bot quickly mirrored other usersâ sexist and racist
language]? Thatâs another source of bias: it seems to be a case where an
algorithm gets led astray because the people it is learning from are not very
nice. **
**

**SUH:** There are some societal and cultural norms that are more acceptable
than others. For each of us as a person, we know and we learn the difference
between what is and isnât acceptable through experience. For an AI system,
thatâs going to require a tremendous amount of thoughtful training. Otherwise,
it wonât pick up on the sarcasm. Itâll pick up on the wrong context in the
wrong situation.

 **ZETTELMEYER:** Thatâs right. In some sense, we face this with our children:
they live in a world that is full of profanity, but we would like them to not
use that language. Itâs very difficult. They need a set of value
instructionsâthey canât just be picking up everything from whatâs around them.

 **SUH:** Absolutely. And Western culture is very different than Eastern
culture, or Middle Eastern culture. So culture must be considered, and the
value code [that the algorithm is trained with] has to be intentionally
designed. And you do that by bringing in policymakers, academics, designers,
and researchers who understand the userâs values in various contexts.

 **ZETTELMEYER:** I think thereâs actually a larger point here that goes even
beyond the notion of bias.

Iâm trained as an economist, and very often economics has not done a
particularly good job at incorporating the notion of âvaluesâ into economic
analysis. Thereâs this very strong sense of wanting to strive for efficiency,
and as long as things are efficient, you can avoid considering whether the
outcomes are beneficial to society.

What I find interesting is that in this entire space of AI and analytics, the
discussion around values is supercharged. I think it has to do with the fact
that analytics and AI are very powerful weapons that can be used in very
strategic, very targeted ways. And as a result of this, it seems absolutely
crucial for an organization that chooses to implement these techniques to have
a code of conduct or a set of values that governs these techniques. Right? I
mean, just because you can do something, doesnât mean that you actually ought
to do it.

Where you have these very powerful tools available that can really move
things, you have an obligation to understand the larger impact.

 **SUH:** Accountability is one of the five areas that we are focusing on for
creating trust in AI.

Many businesses are applying AI to not just create better experiences for
consumers, but to monetize for profit. They may be doing it in ways where,
say, data rights may not be balanced appropriately with the return on economic
value, or efficiency. So itâs an important discussion: Whoâs accountable when
there are risks in addition to benefits? **
**

**ZETTELMEYER:** Do you think this is new?

 **SUH:** I do a little bit, because in previous scenarios, business programs
and applications were programmable. You had to put in the logic and rules
[explicitly]. When you get into machine learning, youâre not going to have
direct human intervention at every step. So then, what are the design
principles that you intended?

 **ZETTELMEYER:** So a fair way of saying this is, in essence, weâve always
had this issue of ownership, except with machine learning, you can potentially
get away with thinking you donât need it.

But youâre saying that thatâs a fallacy, because you do need accountability at
the end of the day when something blows up.

 **SUH:** Exactly. And this goes back to [training an algorithm to have] a
fundamental understanding of right and wrong in a wide range of contexts. You
canât just put the chat bot into the public sphere and say, âHere, just go
learn,â without understanding the implications of how that system actually
learns, and the subsequent consequences.

 **ZETTELMEYER:** Okay, accountability. Whatâs your second focus area to build
trust in AI?

 **SUH:** Itâs a focus on values. What are the norms for a common set of core
principles that you operate under? And depending on different cultural norms,
whom do you bring into the process [of creating these principles]?

Thereâs a third focus area around data rights and data privacy, mostly in
terms of consumer protectionâbecause there are companies that offer an
exchange of data for a free service of some sort, and the consumer might not
realize that theyâre actually giving permission, not just for that one
instance, but for perpetuity.

 **ZETTELMEYER:** Do you think it is realistic today to think of consumers
still having some degree of ownership over their data? **
**

**SUH:** I do think thereâs a way to solve for this. I donât think weâve
solved it yet, but I do think thereâs a possibility of enabling individuals to
understand what information is being used by whom and when.

Part of that is a burden on the institutions around explainability. Thatâs
number fourâbeing able to explain your algorithm: explain the data sets that
were used, explain the approach holistically, be able to detect where you
might have biases. This is why explainability and fairnessâthatâs number
fiveâgo hand in hand.

 **ZETTELMEYER:** In an academic context, I refer to this as transparency of
execution.

I actually thought you were going to say something slightly different, that we
need to move to a place where some of the more flexible algorithms like neural
networks or deep learning can be interpreted.

Itâs a hard problem because, in some sense, precisely what makes these
algorithms work so well is what makes them so hard to explain. In other words,
the problem with these algorithms isnât that you canât write them down. You
can always write them down. The problem is that itâs very difficult to create
some easily understandable association between inputs and outputs, because
everything depends on everything else.

But I think the point you were making is: okay, even if we do have a so-called
âblack boxâ algorithm, a lot of the biases arise, not necessarily from the
algorithm per se, but from the fact that weâre applying this algorithm to a
particular setting and data set, yet itâs just not clear to people how itâs
being implemented.

 **SUH:** Thatâs right.

When and for what purpose are we actually applying AI? What are the major
sources of that data? And how are we working to, if not eliminate bias, maybe
mitigate it?

 **ZETTELMEYER:** I think a lot of the trust problems that have occurred in
the tech industryâand particularly in advertisingâover the last years, are
directly related to a lack of transparency of that type. Iâm always amazed
that when you go to the big advertising platforms, and you approached them
purely as a consumer, and then you approach them as a client, it feels like
youâre dealing with two different universes. As consumer, Iâm not sure you
have the same sense of exactly whatâs happening behind the scenes as you do if
you happen to be an advertiser, and you have exposure to all the digital tools
that you can use for targeting.

I think transparency, the way youâre talking about it, is not particularly
well implemented in many tech companies.

 **SUH:** No. And thereâs not a common language for talking about it either,
in terms of explicitly saying, âWe only use data that we have access and
rights to, and this is how we collect it, and youâve given us permission for
it.â The standards around the language itself are still being developed.

 **ZETTELMEYER:** What are you doing about all this at IBM?

 **SUH:** We actually developed a [360 degrees fairness
kit](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/09/ai-fairness-360/) as part of
our broader [AI OpenScale](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-openscale)
initiative. AI OpenScale is an open technology platform that enables your
business with visibility, control, and the ability to improve AI deployments,
helps explain AI outcomes, and scales AI usage with automated neural network
design and deployment, all within a unified management console. It includes
open-source toolkits to check for unwanted biases in data sets and machine-
learning modules. It checks for biases like explainability around your data
sets to provide feedback on different aspects of your models.

Itâs the first open-platform and open-source toolkit to even begin to get
developers thinking about bias proactively.

 _This is the first in a series of conversations between Kellogg School
faculty and IBM Watson leaders._

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence

This is an article that takes part in a whole work related with Quantum
Machine Learning. If you have not checked the previous articles you can read
them here: <https://medium.com/@agus.bignu97/quantum-algorithms-2b6c9d7f80b9>

As in the previous section, in this one we will introduce the second basic
topic of this paper, artificial intelligence. Specifically, we will focus on
one of its most worked and exploited branches by both the industry and the
research sector: **machine learning** [1].

It is a branch of computing in which a series of algorithms are applied so
that the computer âlearnsâ about data that is introduced. The vast majority of
this data comes in large groups, that is the reason why we call it Big Data.
The algorithms this discipline handles can be of various kinds, since it
depends on the problem that one wishes to solve or attack (we will encounter
three types of learning algorithms).

In turn, this field of AI relias on both statistics and probability since many
learning and decision-making techniques are based on techniques from these
disciplines.

In the field of machine learning we usually find three types of learning:
**supervised, unsupervised** and **reinforcement**.

#### Supervised Learning

In this type of learning, correct examples of what you want the computer to
learn are introduced to it and, with the appropriate algorithm, it must learn
to find the solution on its own. Within this type of learning we find
different problems, specifically: **regression and classification**. We are
going to analyze them more in detail.

The first, **regression** , is used when you want to make predictions. We have
two types of regressions: linear (a) and non-linear (b)

(1)

Both linear and non-linear reflect the relationship between the variables _x_
and _y_. Where _x_ is the information that we introduce to the algorithm, in
other words, with which it âtrainsâ.
In contrast, _y_ is the value that the algorithm returns, that is, what it
predicts. In the formulas (1) the coefficients _w_ are the âweightsâ, these
are updated during the training to the point we want. So, we have a good model
that describes and reproduces our data. Updating weights is the most common
form of learning within machine learning and AI. A method called _gradient
descent_ is used, which is nothing more than an optimization algorithm based
on the error that is made between the known value and the predicted value. For
reasons of space we will not go into detail. Currently, the regression is
being used a lot in real estate and the stock market.

On the other hand we have the classification. Similar to the case of
regression, we can distinguish between binary or multi-class classification.
As in the regression, gradient descent is also used here to update the weights
and so that the computer can learn to recognize which class the information
belongs to. For example, abinary classification could be to distinguish
between cats or dogs in images. This way our classes would be âcatâ and âdogâ
and in the training one would introduce a considerable number of correct
images to create a learning rule. Later this would allow us to recognize dogs
and cats in images that the algorithm has never seen before. Not only in
images, it can also be used to recognize voice patterns, numerical data of
various kinds, etc.

#### Unsupervised Learning

Unlike supervised learning, now we do not previously know the correct answer.
That is, we only have data that one introduces in the computer. So the main
objective of this type of algorithm is looking for patterns, regularities,
irregularities or other things in the data. In other words, shred and analyze
the data. This is very useful in data science where a person or a team of
people must analyze large amounts of data.

Two major problems within unsupervised learning are the **detection of
anomalies** and **clustering**.

The latter is used when we want to find relationships within the data we
enter. An example could be the information a supermarket has about its
customers and their tastes. They could get to know what kind of customers buy
in their stores as a result of the best selling products. If a person would
have to analyze all of these he could spend days or months to reach to the
same conclusions. In contrast, a well-applied algorithm in a computer with
good computing power could do it in a matter of hours.

As for the detection of anomalies, as its name suggests, it is about finding
irregularities in data. That is, applying an algorithm to learn a specific
task or to detect a specific pattern and then focus on what does not
recognize, ignores or does not fit the learning rule established by the
algorithm. This helps us understand the input data. Nowadays a very useful
application is in the detection of frauds of all kinds.

#### Reinforcement Learning

This type of learning is the one that is booming the most in the past few
years. In some applications the result of a system is a series of actions, for
example a game. One must make decisions based on what happens in the game.
That is, the information that one receives helps you make future decisions and
based on your decisions you can win or lose. So you can say that if you make
good decisions you will win the game but if you take bad you will lose. But
one can learn from bad decisions in order to avoid the same mistakes in the
future. This example of a game is what reinforcement learning is based on.

In reinforcement learning we can find four basic definitions: a **state** , an
**action** , an **agent** and what could be called a **policy** taken to the
example of the game. Letâs try to shed light on these definitions by returning
to the example of the game. The agent would be the player. The state would be
the box in which the agent is or the moment of the game in which it is. The
action is what the agent can do based on the information that comes to him,
that is, the movement he can make, the possibilities he has, etc. Finally, the
policy is the succession of actions carried out by the agent and the state to
which he arrives by making those decisions. The goal is to win the game, in
this case. The basis of this type of behavior are the _Markov chains_. They
are used to make decisions motivated by a reward or punishment given to the
agent by the decision made.

Other applications, apart from games, in which reinforcement learning is
taking part in are robotics and autonomous driving. In the first one, this
type of learning is used to make decisions and to learn different tasks. In
the second, vehicles that drive themselves are getting better and better. It
can be seen in companies like Tesla. This will take us to a future in which we
will not need a driverâs license.

#### Conclusions

In this article we have introduced the types of learning we can face within
**_machine learning._** This will help us understand the two following
articles in which we are going to talk about four different algorithms of
machine learning that we are going to use in the final section of this work.

__label__AI	"Itâs easy to get lost amidst all the uncertainty and speculation, but when we
do, we may fail to see whatâs happening right in front of us right now. AI is
already creating new forms of employment. In fact, researchers at Accenture
have identified several new categories of jobs spurred by AI. This research is
featured in the _MIT Sloan Management Review_ article âThe Jobs That
Artificial Intelligence Will Create.â Iâm joined by authors H. James Wilson
and Paul Daugherty for a look at the findings from their first round of
research and what they have learned since about the new roles that AI is
creating in the organization. Jim and Paul, welcome, and thanks for taking the
time to talk about the work you and your colleagues are doing to help us
understand AIâs impact on employment.

**Paul Daugherty:** Yeah, we started this about two-and-a-half years ago when
Jim and I were looking at the advance of AI and the current state of a lot of
the discussions around AI. And we became concerned about the type of dialogue
that was happening. As you say, there certainly is a massive impact on the way
work is done, brought on by AI. But in our early experience, we saw a lot of
promise for AI to change jobs and create jobs and make more human jobs â or
make jobs more human â in many steps. So Jim and I launched this research
project to look at 1,500 organizations and how they were using AI and how it
was impacting their business, their workforce, and the things that they did in
the company. And the finding was that contrary to what a lot of people think,
we believe AI will create a lot of novel new jobs. It will certainly eliminate
some jobs, but we believe that the net effect will be creating a lot of jobs â
and jobs that are good jobs that leverage our human capability in different
ways. Broadly speaking, we came up with three categories of jobs that we call
_trainer_ , _explainer_ , and _sustainer_ â three categories of new jobs where
weâre using our human capability in different ways to allow AI to have the
positive impact on the way we work, the way we live, and overall a positive
impact on outcomes.

**Paul Michelman:** Thanks, Paul. Letâs walk through each of these categories,
beginning with trainer.

**James Wilson:** So we initially did that research of about 1,500 companies,
and we didnât initially see these three job categories, but when we started to
dig down into the research, when we started to do follow-up case studies,
thatâs where we really started to see these jobs surface â managers that we
were interviewing talking about writing fundamentally new job descriptions.
And we actually saw recurring job titles [and] job categories that they were
writing for. One of those job categories is the trainer role. And these are
the people that are quite often doing the data science. Theyâre doing the
machine learning engineering. Theyâre the ones that are actively building the
AI systems. One of the things that we see is that even within the same
company, there can be a lot of variety within a particular job category, like
a trainer job. So, for instance, Tesla: You can see that the carmaker is
recruiting line managers with experience in robotics, and robot engineers and
computer vision researchers, and deep learning scientists and machine learning
systems experts. So really rich variety â even within that one trainer
category within a single company.

**Paul Michelman:** And Jim, trainers are exclusively technology experts?

**James Wilson:** No, not necessarily. And we can talk some more about that.
You know, itâs important to have functional experts on your team, as well. It
might be that you have a person with a marketing background or an operations
background on your team helping identify and solve problems that the technical
experts â for instance, the data scientists â will then go in and solve for.

**Paul Daugherty:** And just to add on, one specific type of job we see here
in the trainer category are the AI personality trainers â somebody who can
behaviorally train the chatbots and intelligent virtual agents that so many
companies are deploying right now. Companies deploy those solutions to
interact (voice-driven interaction) with their consumers and such. What
theyâre realizing is that AI becomes the brand. And so you need to train it to
behave in the right way, to operate the right way, to have the right answers,
the right tone, etc. And thatâs a nontechnical type of job thatâs needed to
shape that type of behavior and [to] work with the engineers to get that
behavior implemented in the right way in the solutions.

**Paul Michelman:** Great. Letâs move on to the second category, which you
label explainers.

**Paul Daugherty:** Explainers is one that I think is getting to the fact that
AI is embedded in very complex systems and business processes. And so thereâs
an issue both of explaining AI itself and how itâs working, but more broadly
explaining the kinds of outcomes that are being generated by the systems that
are being developed. For example, if you think about a self-driving car, it
has a lot of AI embedded in it, but thereâs lots of other driving systems and
things included. So when you think about autonomous vehicles and whatâs
happening, what weâre seeing is companies creating roles [for] people to
understand the overall context of the system â the environmental conditions,
the road conditions, lots of things in addition to the AI itself and how it
was behaving, so that they can understand and tune the systems to operate more
effectively.... Understanding that impact is the [type of job] weâre seeing in
the explainer category.

**James Wilson:** In some cases, these explainer roles are actually being
encouraged through regulation. So this year by some estimates there were about
75,000 new explainer roles being created related to the GDPRâs right to
[explanation]. And these are analysts in banks, for instance, and in customer
service centers and that sort of thing, [who] answer customersâ questions
about an algorithmic decision.

**Paul Michelman:** So are explainers always an interface between the
organization and the public? Or are they also interfacing within parts of the
organization?

**James Wilson:** They quite often are interfacing with parts of the
organization as well. So, for instance, in health care weâre seeing a lot of
early evidence that explainers are working with physicians in explaining why
an AI system is making a particular recommendation and whether then the doctor
can go on and make a medical recommendation to a patient as a result. They
often are working in health care settings, making interpretations and sharing
insights with medical professionals, not necessarily patients or customers.

**Paul Michelman:** So letâs move to the third category: sustainers.

**Paul Daugherty:** This is really speaking to the roles that are needed to
manage AI (the use of AI) and to make sure that it not only behaves right at
the outset, but it continues to behave properly to produce the desired
outcomes over time, because the technology changes, the data changes, the
situation changes, the business changes. And sustainer roles are people who
really understand the outcomes that need to be driven to make sure that that
outcome and that impact is sustained.

**James Wilson:** They also spend a good deal of their day thinking about
unintended consequences from AI systems and how those end up being received by
the public. So, for instance, surge pricing. Is a surge pricing model going to
be something that is sustainable for a company? That was an issue, obviously,
that some of the firms like Uber and Lyft had to deal with initially. How do
you come up with a surge-pricing model thatâs algorithm-driven but also is
sustainable? Things like biased algorithms, discriminatory facial recognition
systems â these are things that [the] first wave of trainers didnât
necessarily think about, but now sustainers think about whether these
unanticipated, unintended consequences are something that can be managed. Or
maybe they might even recommend that an AI system has to be taken out of
operation until the company figures out how to get it right.

**Paul Michelman:** Whatâs an example of a title that a sustainer might have
in the organization?

**Paul Daugherty:** I think sustainers can manifest themselves in a number of
ways. Weâre seeing this often as augmenting the team or the work thatâs being
done in different situations. For example, in manufacturing or factory types
of situations where theyâre using collaborative robots and different types of
technology that need to be continually configured and rearranged to meet the
dynamic needs of the supply chain and what theyâre producing â sustainer roles
in that sense would be the technician whoâs reorganizing and managing the
interface between the robots and the production process thatâs being
performed. So those are the types of roles that we see there.

**James Wilson:** You know, just driving up and down the streets of San
Francisco, youâre going to pass a number of autonomous vehicles. But of
course, sitting behind that robo-car is an AI safety trainer. And so you see a
lot of those roles in autonomous vehicle situations. In general, any company
thatâs building robotic systems is going to be hiring these AI safety or AI
compliance officers that really make sure at a basic level that the systems
that theyâre deploying are safe in the public.

**Paul Michelman:** You did this research, originally, two years ago. And I
guess in terms of the longevity of management ideas, two years is really not
that long a period of time. But in the world of AI, we almost should be
talking about dog years, I think â two years seems like a long time. So Iâm
wondering: When youâre looking at the market today, when youâre looking at
employment trends today, would you stick to these three categories? Have they
evolved? How has your thinking shifted, if at all?

**Paul Daugherty:** Yeah, I think thereâs a little bit of both. Iâll talk
first about what we see with the categories we identified. If you look at
trainers, explainers, and sustainers, I think we see more evidence every day
of how these roles are growing and increasing. For example, if you look at job
postings, which we were researching a little while ago, you can find
_explainer_ in job titles now â Algorithm Explainability Engineer and
Financial Services Explainability Specialist and things like that â the need
to explain the algorithms and the AI. Weâre seeing this accelerate, I think,
as you said, in this dog-year type of fashion. Weâve also seen some compelling
examples from some of the early entrants of why you need these roles. I think
Facebook is an instructive story. What theyâve done, following all the focus
on them around Cambridge Analytica, is theyâve created tens of thousands of
new jobs to add humans in to manage the algorithms and produce the results
that people really want, in a more responsible fashion. And those are
sustainer jobs â itâs people added in. I think Facebookâs comment was along
the lines of: Weâve concluded algorithms canât manage the algorithms, we need
people to manage the algorithms. And those arenât isolated incidents. I think
those are examples of the roles that all companies are going to need as they
deploy the technology.

**James Wilson:** Yeah, our article focused on unprecedented new job
categories where people are out there developing and responsibly managing AI
systems. But while AI is certainly creating new jobs, itâs also changing old
jobs by augmenting them. And we didnât get into that much in that initial
article. For example, at one bioscience company that weâve been looking at â
itâs based out here in the Bay Area â scientists use robotic lab equipment to
help on certain experimental tasks. The robotic helpers precisely squirt
liquids and they plate cells and they count microbe colonies in a way that
augments and accelerates scientific work. And as a result of this robot
augmentation, scientists are now able to complete about 400 times more
experiments each week. So if you think about that, a scientist now has the
potential to make a hundred yearsâ worth of scientific discovery in a single
year through AI augmentation. But you know the lab scientistâs job content has
really changed quite a bit. She now does things that are quite a bit different
than she was doing before and has different ways of doing them. And we didnât
get into that topic as much. We were much more focused on the job creation,
not the job content change.

**Paul Michelman:** When weâre looking at the three fully new categories of
jobs, how equally and evenly distributed are these roles going to be? Are
there particular industries or types of organizations for which these roles
are going to emerge earlier? Are there other organizations that should take
kind of a sit-back-and-wait approach?

**James Wilson:** I would make two points here. The first is that companies
really need all three roles. For instance, a few years ago many of the most
advanced AI firms â the major technology companies, for instance â focused
exclusively on staffing AI trainers. But now theyâre playing catch up. So you
really do need to have all three. But I think one insight here is that the AI
talent war is quite a bit different and broader than a lot of people initially
thought. My second point is that the distribution of the roles is going to
vary quite a bit by industry and customer and regulatory context.

**Paul Michelman:** When weâre looking at these new categories, it would seem
that one of the fundamental challenges organizations face is that these are
jobs that no one has done before. No one has ever trained to be an AI trainer.
How do we solve for that?

**Paul Daugherty:** Thatâs one of the biggest challenges that I think we have
to face as we look at how do we prepare people for these new roles and how do
businesses and organizations prepare for these new roles. Weâve done some
follow-on research on this, and we think thereâs three things that we really
need to focus on to get this right. One is focusing more on experiential
learning. If you look at traditional training, it would show that people
forget 80% of what they learn within about a day of learning it from
traditional training methods. So how do you get people engaged in the learning
process in the experiential way? We think apprenticeships are very important â
hands-on learning, learning injected at different points in the process. For
example, weâve done an interesting training and learning approach with a large
aircraft manufacturer, where we used AI and mixed-reality technology to equip
workers with a mixed-reality headset that helps them understand the job they
were doing and do higher-skilled jobs faster by providing them guidance along
the way. And thatâs an example of using technology plus experiential learning
to advance people skills into these new categories.

A second thing we found is important is shifting the burden from just the
person needing to learn to looking [at] the responsibility [that] different
institutions â businesses, etc. â have for the training. One thing we firmly
believe is that every organization needs to look at learning as a core
competency in a really new and fresh way. And you need to think about learning
platforms from lifelong learning as a core part of what you do. Because to
your point, you canât go hire people for some of these roles, you may need to
build people to do them. For example, we worked with an oil company on a new
drilling technology that uses visualization and AI and gaming engines to
create a whole different way for a technician to operate a drill (oil
drilling, operating miles underground). So where are you going to hire the
gaming engine, visualization-inspired driller? Youâre not going to find people
on the market with those skills. Youâre going to have to take your current
technicians and develop these new digital skills in them, which is why we
believe that these learning platforms are going to be a critical component for
companies. Itâs going to be differentiating for those who can get it right.

And then finally, from an overall societal and multi-stakeholder perspective,
we need to look at how we enable vulnerable people in the population [who] are
already maybe separated by a digital divide â who donât have the right
baseline skills to operate in this environment â and do more to make sure that
everybodyâs got the base of skills that [they] need to participate in these
jobs.

**Paul Michelman:** So this is really interesting. On the one hand, a focus on
on-the-job learning, experiential learning, certainly promises or would seem
to promise a shorter time frame and maybe more stickiness to get people
trained up for these new roles. And yet, thatâs still a major organizational
undertaking â maybe not as great as relying on academia to fill the void,
which will take decades â but still these jobs need to be done. They may not
be fully at scale, but as you guys have noted, theyâre very much real and
happening right now. So as we look at these three categories, where should
that first crop of people come from?

**James Wilson:** Well, I think one thing that we can do today is to make it
easier for people to become trainers, explainers, and sustainers by basically
lowering the barrier to building or improving an AI system â what Paul and I
call _AI democratization_. Weâre already beginning to see point-and-click AI
training tools out there. And many of the cloud AI services providers, for
instance, are quite easy to use. If you have a data set, you can just upload
the data set to one of these services and then start playing around with the
data. So I think the complement to what Paul was just talking about, which was
raising the skill level, is also at the same time to lower the barrier to
using these systems. I think thatâs a really important thing. And itâs often
an untapped opportunity, but weâre beginning to see more and more companies
migrating toward that model as well.

**Paul Michelman:** In terms of global impact for these new categories of jobs
in particular â and I realize this is going to be a difficult question to
answer in particulars â so general trends would be fine, but I think a lot of
people would like some help in sizing the opportunity that your research
suggests, especially as we think about potential job loss at the hands of AI,
machine learning, and automation. Are the new jobs weâre discussing here a
relative drop in the bucket for the highly specialized few or well-trained
few? What is this going to look like at scale?

**Paul Daugherty:** These jobs certainly are a drop in the bucket, but you
have to put it in context. We think this is a major impact â these jobs are a
major impact going forward on employment and opportunity for people. However,
just to start, there will be a lot of disruption in the labor force, and there
will be categories of jobs that are at risk for automation. But you have to
look at the broad spectrum of how thatâll happen. And from the research weâve
done, if you look across categories of jobs, if you look at the content of
work, thereâs about 10% of work generally that we found through our research
is human-only (only humans can do). Thereâs about 35% of work that is
automatable â that part of the work is automatable by machines, algorithms,
etc. And the rest of the work â which is the majority of it â is really
augmentable, which means you can improve the way humans do it, but itâs
largely going to need to be done by humans. And I think that the context
around these new jobs is [that] most of the jobs become transformed in
different ways. And how do we use AI and other technology to transform the
jobs to prepare people for those changed jobs? So thatâs a big impact, and I
would say almost every job will change as a result of the technology. Many new
jobs will be created and some will be eliminated.

One good data point, having just come from a G7 meeting recently: Canada
announced that through their investment theyâre making, they expect a $16
billion economic increase in output as a result of the investments theyâre
making in AI. Thatâs significant output. They talk about 16,000 jobs theyâre
creating through the focus on AI. And we see similar types of impacts and
results around the world and larger impacts in terms of GDP increase (economic
output increase) by countries. And thatâs where the opportunity is â in kind
of envisioning how do we prepare people for these new types of jobs that will
be created?

**James Wilson:** Yeah, just building on Paulâs point, I think you can get a
good quantitative sense of the size of opportunity by looking at business
leadersâ investment expectations, especially around growth. In our research,
for instance, we found that firms that invest in their AI workforce at the
same rate as top-performing businesses in their sector are going to grow both
revenues but also their workforce.

**Paul Daugherty:** Thereâs another impact on jobs that I think we need to
think about, which is the fact that itâs hard to anticipate where the new jobs
are coming from and what the new jobs will look like. Thatâs why we try to be
prescriptive and talk about trainers and explainers and sustainers. One
historical observation Iâd offer is that if you look back at prior technology
waves weâve had â 20 years ago, people wouldnât have anticipated that weâd
have large categories of people employed in things like search engine
optimizers, web designers, eBay retail merchants, etc. In a similar fashion,
weâre already seeing this creation of the new jobs going forward, and theyâre
the unanticipated, new things that we need to continue to be creative about
and look for as time goes on.

**Paul Michelman:** So whatâs next in your research?

**James Wilson:** In our research, we see that about 69% of executives believe
that their industry is going to be completely transformed between now and 2022
as a result of AI. But we continue to try to understand not only the jobs that
are going to be created, but also the skills that are going to help this
transformation â that are going to enable this transformation. And I think
this is an important area for our research. Paulâs already set it up very
nicely. A lot of our findings thus far have been surprising to us. For
instance, you might think that STEM skills are the be-all and end-all for the
age of AI. But our research is showing that four distinctively soft skills are
becoming much more valuable as we begin collaborating with smart machines and
using smart machines: These are complex reasoning, creativity,
social/emotional intelligence, and certain forms of sensory perceptionâ¦. So
interestingly, one thing that weâre tracking now is how skills are becoming
softer. And what does that look like on an AI team?

**Paul Daugherty:** Yeah, I think going further on those human skills. Because
one question we get a lot is exactly that, which is: âOK, Paul and Jim, we get
you, we believe what youâre laying out here. What do I do tomorrow? What do I
do next month to start preparing my people and my workforce?â Getting to that
next level of specificity â the human skills and how we get people ready â I
think is really important. Thereâs a couple other fronts weâve launched. One
is on responsible AI, which we hinted at in the original article, but itâs
really become more important, which is: How do we make sure we get the right
outcomes from AI? Speaking of things like transparency and explainability,
which one of our job categories addresses; thinking about bias, which is an
issue that many have run into when they apply AI â creating biased outcomes
rather than inclusive outcomes; thinking about accountability; thinking about
trustworthiness and issues like that. So weâre doing a lot of further work on
that. In fact, we have a new article in _MIT SMR_ on fairness and approaches
to fairness with AI and some work weâve done in that area. These are going to
be really important issues for businesses and organizations to grasp and to
make sure that as we have increasing numbers of people working in AI and more
powerful solutions delivered with the AI, how do we make sure we deliver the
right outcomes in all cases?

**Paul Michelman:** Terrific. Paul Daugherty, Jim Wilson, thank you both very
much.

**Paul Daugherty:** Thank you, Paul.

**James Wilson:** Thank you, Paul.

__label__Cloud	"<p>In order to convert an unorganized 3d point cloud into a 2d image, you have to (to the best of my knowledge) do a grid raycast:</p>

<p>To simulate a real camera, you would pick some point that is a distance away from what you are imaging (your target) and then you would set up a grid of points between it (camera point) and your target center.  The grid should be in the plane normal to the vector between the target and camera.  The width and height (in conjunction with the distance between camera and grid) of that grid will set up your FOV (the angle in x and y that your camera will see).  The number of points in rows and columns will set up your resolution.  The final step is to raycast through all the points on the grid (in order) to create an organized 2d image.  To raycast, you simply calculate the normalized vector from the camera to any given grid point and then progressively add that vector (times your search step length which is likely about the same as your search radius) to the point (moving the point towards your target) and checking if there are any points from the target cloud within some radius at each step.  If you find a target inside the radius, record that intensity into your image and move on to the next grid point.  Make sure you put a limit on how far the ray can cast (the distance between your camera and furthest target point for instance).  Although you could just use a static search radius based on your known cloud resolution of your target, you could also be fancy and make the radius scale larger, linearly correlated to distance from camera (this would be more elegant and correct to how a camera actually works).</p>

<p>*To clarify, drawing the grid is not actually necessary as it can all be done with applying appropriate rotations to the normal vector to get all the projection vectors.  The concept of a grid is just much easier to visualize.</p>

<p>One final note is that this is not real world, so you could do another thing, a parallel raycast: Much the same as before but instead of a camera point you just create the grid and then project along the grid's surface normal for all points (so they move parallel to eachother instead of spreading out pyramidally).  This does some pretty interesting things  (specifically with edges and object occlusion) and could be useful depending on what you need this image for.</p>

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence

In the first/classical paradigm of Artificial Intelligence we had classical
binary computing systems that used algorithms to mimic logical human thinking
and machine learning. The Turing Test a.k.a. Imitation Game was designed to
score this, by measuring the systemâs probability of being misidentified as a
human subject.

The end result of the classical paradigm would be for example the chatbot
[Eugene Goostman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman),
[Cleverbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleverbot) or the Google AI.

The second paradigm of Artificial Intelligence would define AI more
holistically as:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an autonomous, embodied, situated and self-
sufficient system utilizing an enactive Bayesian cognitive brain powered by
Quantum Computing (QC) and driven by the laws of the Free Energy Principle,
actively and purposely engaged in the quest of achieving and embodying
Artificial Consciousness (AC).

The end result of the second AI paradigm would be for example the fictional
character [Lieutenant Commander Data
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_%28Star_Trek%29)from Star Trek.

The third paradigm of Artificial Intelligence would implement emotions with
the help of more advanced QC distributed more granularly, actively and
purposely engaged in the quest of embodying/transferring Human Consciousness
(HC). Having achieved this milestone, the human kind will embark in the
ultimate quest towards physical immortality.

That is if the AI doesnât destroy humans first. That being said, it is in our
nature to try anyway and to be honest thereâs only one way to find out."

<p><em>Private IP connectivity requires additional APIs and permissions. You may need to contact your organisation's administrator for help enabling or using this feature. Currently, Private IP cannot be disabled once it has been enabled.</em></p>

__label__AI	"# _Artificial Intelligence Needs Government Regulation_

 _Artificial intelligence is an aspect of technology that is constantly and
rapidly evolving in todayâs virtual platforms. While artificial intelligence
has a vast array of benefits for both producers and consumers, there are also
some safety considerations that should be observed in order to execute the
resources that artificial intelligence has to offer securely. Currently,
producers and manufacturers have full control of artificial intelligence while
consumers at the mercy of the programâs functional purpose. Applying
government regulation to protect consumers from the dangers of artificial
intelligence can help to ensure that society is protected from malicious
intent utilized through artificial intelligence functionalities._

 _Artificial intelligence consists of algorithms developed by programmers to
target a specific function and gather information to be utilized for an
ongoing purpose. One example of the use of artificial intelligence is market
research on a consumerâs buying habits being used in an algorithm to display
appealing ads to the consumer. Artificial intelligence mines for and gathers
data from consumers or files from equipment in order to develop an
interpretation of that information that can be used for a specific purpose
designated by the programmer. (_ âArtificial Intelligence Historyâ) _The
ability for a programmer to instruct or create a set of rules for a program to
follow that will manipulate date and information in an organized manner with a
specific intent is very valuable to producers that market to consumers because
it can motivate consumers through influence. Artificial intelligence can be
used just as a television ad is used to target consumers, however it is much
more personalized to the specific consumer seeing the advertisement because it
has gathered personal information about the buyerâs spending habits._

 _Consumers often times wonder why they see ads targeted specifically to their
personal tastes when they are scrolling through their social media platforms,
or when ads pop up on their computer screen due to cookies being placed on
sites they have previously visited. Many consumers are not knowledgeable about
how artificial intelligence can manipulate the information they are absorbing
frequently. While this may not seem like a dangerous issue or threat to
society, it is important to realize that children are seeing this information
in the same way when they utilize online platforms. Children might be
bombarded with ads frequently of something that they have previously searched
for, and sometimes that information is highly unhealthy or unethical for
children to be absorbing. Children can have negative emotional consequences
from the coercion that artificial intelligence can enforce if they are seeing
fearful or discriminatory advertisements._

 _Government regulation can enforce rules and inflict consequences for misuse
of artificial intelligence, the best strategy for keeping artificial
intelligence from causing negative impacts to users is to increase awareness
among society. Emphasizing the importance of establishing good digital
citizenship, monitoring childrenâs activity online, educating children on how
to conduct online activity safely, and building a positive online environment
that reports and monitors safety concerns is essential for protecting society.
Artificial intelligence can be constructed by a programmer to carry out a very
specific and detailed set of instructions that can be very precise and
accurate. (_ âA Brief History of AI.â) _Importance should be placed on
devising proper rules and regulations for programmers to ensure that the
source of the artificial intelligence is reliable, secure and has good
intentions. While the consequences of misusing artificial intelligence or
being successfully manipulated by artificial intelligence falls upon the end
user, it should still be noted that the artificial intelligence was created by
a human base with a set of intentions and instructions._

 _Artificial intelligence is generally resourceful and benefitting, however it
also has some disadvantages and drawbacks. Benefits of artificial intelligence
include more personalized, targeted advertising for producers trying to reach
consumers and more appealing information for users of artificial intelligence
based on their personal interests. Artificial intelligence can be used to
promote creativity and help people build businesses or promote their ideas.
Artificial intelligence can also help to relieve some job functions that used
to require a lot of manual labor, such as sending out e-mails and doing
research data on consumers. The drawbacks of artificial intelligence include
the lack of privacy involved with analyzing user preferences so closely,
potential violations of privacy rights and misuse of personal information, as
well as manipulative or deceptive advertising that can negatively impact a
user emotionally. (_ âBenefits & Risks of Artificial Intelligence.â)

 _Government regulation can help to ensure that adult and children consumers
are protected from manipulative or deceptive advertising practices that could
have negative emotional impacts on society. Government regulation can also
help to ensure that producers are not using ill intentions or discriminatory
advertising in their marketing strategies. Government regulation can enforce
fairness and equality within the economy as artificial intelligence continues
to grow as a strong resource for advertising techniques. Government regulation
can also help to prevent programmers from creating algorithms that cause
negative effects on the general society, such as creating artificial
intelligence that harasses or discriminates against a specific audience._

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence

###  **What is AI?**

The most frequently used word in fields of technology is Artificial
Intelligence(AI). It is as cool as it sounds and so it has always been
intriguing me. It is hard to define AI in one single sentence, but it can be
considered as making machines intelligent. That is making machines perform
tasks like reasoning, problem solving, learning, planning and perception which
are basically executed by human brain.

Artificial Intelligence was firstly applied just on game playing(like chess),
but now its application has widened beyond our imagination. It is now
everywhere, in health care, manufacturing, education, finance, law and in
various kinds of businesses. The words(which are also closely related to AI)
like Machine Learning(ML), Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Robotics are
no new to most of us. But for those who are not aware, here is a short
explanation:

Â· **Machine Learning** : It is an application of AI which gives the ability to
learn and improve from experience automatically(like human brain! Though many
of us donât really âimproveâ from experience :P).

Â· **NLP** : It is the ability of machines to understand human language.

Â· **Robotics** : It consists of designing and building robots which often
perform tasks that are difficult even for humans to perform(letâs just not
forget Spirit and Opportunity Rovers!)

Artificial Intelligence can be categorized into two parts: Weak AI and Strong
AI. Weak AI is designed to do some specific tasks, and its most simple example
is Appleâs Siri. Strong AI consists of generalized human cognitive abilities.
It can be used in complex situations to find out answers which may be
uncertain; IBM Watson is the best example of it. While narrow AI may
outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or
solving equations, Artificial General Intelligence(AGI) would outperform
humans at nearly every cognitive task.

###  **Benefits**

 **1**. **Increase in work efficiency** : AI-powered machines can work 24X7,
unlike humans. For example, AI-powered chat assistants can answer customer
queries and provide support to visitors every minute of the day.

 **2**. **More accurate work** : AI eliminates the compulsion of human
intervention and hence, removes all scope for human error.

 **3**. **Reduced cost of training and operation** : AI uses machine learning
algorithms like Deep Learning and Neural Networks to learn new things like
humans do. This way, they eliminate the need to write new code every time we
need them to learn new things.

 **4**. **Improved processes** : AI-powered machines can collect a large
amount of data for any particular work allowing us to gather deep insights.

 **5**. **Difficult exploration:** Robots can be put to use in mining and
other explorations which may be dangerous for humans. For example, AI-powered
machines can be used to explore ocean floor, hence overcoming human
limitations.

 **6**. **Enhanced Automation** : AI can performs intensive human labor easily
without the need for human intervention.

###  **Risks**

Well it is obvious that there are lots of benefits of AI and it has been a
dream for a long time for humans to create machines that have the ability to
take decisions on their own. However, it is feared by some notable individuals
like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk. Here are some reasons why AI seems scary:

 **1\. Unemployment** : Automation will obviously eliminate human roles in
certain jobs and hence lead to large scale of unemployment.

 **2**. **Threat to privacy** : It is possible to track and analyze our every
move online. Cameras are nearly everywhere, and facial recognition algorithms
know who you are.

 **3\. Autonomous weapons** : Many countries are developing autonomous weapons
in the form of battlefield robots. If these bots are self-improving, it may
lead to unintended consequences.

 **4\. Discrimination:** It is wonderful that machines can now collect so much
of data for specific purposes. But as they can track and analyze so much about
us, our data can be used against us. Imagine, you are not insurable because
the insurance company caught you many times on the camera talking on the
phone.

These risks cannot be neglected, but as the good outweigh the bad, steps
should be taken to reduce the risks; like some ethical codes and policies can
be created to ensure that the risks associated with AI are reduced to the
minimum.

###  **Future of AI**

1\. Automated transportation: Self driving vehicles will be a common thing in
future. This may help in reducing the possibilities of accidents.

2\. Researchers believe that humans will be able to augment themselves with
computers and enhance their own natural abilities. For example, brain will be
able to communicate with the robotic limb to give the patient more control
over it.

3\. Robots: Presently, robots do not have emotions, but in future robots may
be able to read human emotions and even produce their own; they will be good
friends to us by helping us to stay happy. Moreover, robots will help elderly
people for doing every day work, helping them to stay independent.

4\. There may be some technology to connect the human brain with machines.
Like, you just have to think of switching on the TV for actually switching it
on!"

__label__AI	"# **Artificial Intelligence**

From _SIRI_ to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI) is progressing
rapidly. While science fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-like
characteristics, AI can encompass anything from Googleâs search algorithms to
IBMâs Watson to autonomous weapons.

[ **Artificial Intelligence**](https://wrytin.com/tanzilmahmood/anything-you-
can-do-ai-can-do-better-jszx1knj) (AI) is the branch of computer sciences that
emphasizes the development of intelligence machines, thinking and working like
humans. For example, speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and
planning.

Today, Artificial Intelligence is a very popular subject that is widely
discussed in the technology and business circles. Many experts and industry
analysts argue that AI or machine learning is the future â but if we look
around, we are convinced that itâs not the future â it is the present.

In the following, we are listing down 9 very intelligent AI solutions that we
are using today, marketing machine learning as a present thing â not the
future.

### 1.Siri

Siri is Appleâs personal assistant for iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS devices
that uses [voice
recognition](https://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/voice-recognition)
and is powered by artificial intelligence
([AI](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/AI-Artificial-
Intelligence)). Siriâs functions live primarily in the cloud, including the
main automatic [speech
recognition](https://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/speech-recognition)
and **N**[ **atural language
interpretation**](https://wrytin.com/tanzilmahmood/anything-you-can-do-ai-can-
do-better-jszx1knj) **.**

The friendly female voice-activated assistant interacts with the user on a
daily routine. She assists us to find information, get directions, send
messages, make voice calls, open applications and add events to the calendar.

Siri uses machine-learning technology in order to get smarter and capable-to-
understand natural language questions and requests. It is surely one of the
most iconic examples of machine learning abilities of gadgets.

### Tesla

Not only smartphones but automobiles are also shifting towards Artificial
Intelligence. Tesla is something you are missing if you are a car geek. This
is one of the best automobiles available until now. The car has not only been
able to achieve many accolades but also features like self-driving, predictive
capabilities, and absolute technological innovation.

If you are a technology geek and dreamt of owning a car like shown in
Hollywood movies, Tesla is one you need in your garage. The car is getting
smarter day by day through over the air updates.

### 3\. Netflix

Netflix needs no introduction â it is a widely popular content-on-demand
service that uses predictive technology to offer recommendations on the basis
of consumersâ reaction, interests, choices, and behavior. The technology
examines from a number of records to recommend movies based on your previous
liking and reactions.

It is turning more intelligent with each passing year. The only the drawback
of this technology is that small movie go unnoticed while big films grow and
propagate on the platform. But as I wrote earlier, it is still improving and
learning to be more intelligent.

### 4.Pandora

Pandora is one of the most popular and highly demanded tech solutions that
exist. It is also called the DNA of music. Depending on 400 musical
characteristics, the team of expert musicians individually analyzes the song.
The system is also good at recommending the track record for recommending
songs that would never get noticed, despite peopleâs liking.

### 5\. Nest (Google)

Nest was one of the most famous and successful artificial intelligence
startups and it was acquired by Google in 2014 for $3.2 billion. The Nest
Learning Thermostat uses behavioral algorithms to save energy based on your
behavior and schedule.

It employs a very intelligent machine learning process that learns the
temperature you like and programs itself in about a week. Moreover, it will
automatically turn off to save energy, if nobody is at home.

In fact, it is a combination of both â artificial intelligence as well as
Bluetooth low-energy because some components of this solution will use BLE
services and solutions.

### 6\. Flying Drones

The flying drones are already shipping products to customers home â though on
a test mode. They indicate a powerful machine learning system that can
translate the environment into a 3D model through sensors and video cameras.

The sensors and cameras are able to notice the position of the drones in the
room by attaching them to the ceiling. Trajectory generation algorithm guides
the drone on how and where to move. Using a Wi-Fi system, we can control the
drones and use them for specific purposes â product delivery, video-making, or
news reporting.

 _AI is the most powerful as well as fast developing technology all over the
world. AI one type of artificial consciousness that work is done by command of
human but there is no doubt of that AI do work more efficient, better and
cheaply than humans and most of the business now use AI for complete their
work._

 _AI has a very bright future all over the world. in the future mostly work
and field depend on_[ ** _Artificial
Intelligence_**](https://wrytin.com/tanzilmahmood/anything-you-can-do-ai-can-
do-better-jszx1knj) _._

Im confused about the usage of terms like controller nodes, compute nodes when
it comes to Openstack. Since openstack is a collection of software

mean here? Does a compute node mean a node/machine runnning exclusively

The machine that provides your Cloud Shell session is temporary, and it is recycled after your session is inactive for 20 minutes. Cloud Shell requires an Azure file share to be mounted. As a result, your subscription must be able to set up storage resources to access Cloud Shell. Other considerations include:</p>

<p>With mounted storage, only modifications within the clouddrive directory are persisted. In Bash, your $HOME directory is also persisted.
Azure file shares can be mounted only from within your assigned region.
In Bash, run env to find your region set as ACC_LOCATION.
Azure Files supports only locally redundant storage and geo-redundant storage accounts.</p>

__label__Cloud	"Hi guys,



I want to learn cloud environments. It is the future, my company is mostly on
prem and whatever we have in the cloud is not owned by my group. Every job
listing out there wants someone with deep knowledge of the cloud.



Where can I start learning about cloud both in infrastructure and security? I
really dont know where or how to begin...



Is it fair to say that one should treat a cloud system as they would with an
on prem mentality just sitting elsewhere? That is how I have been attacking
cloud security when it comes to architecture, but when it comes to building
cloud for various purposes (not a system engineer) I think this is where I
need to build a better skillset on. I am making the assumption you build it
out as you would for any environment you would on-prem same components but
making sure that more rules are in place.



Thanks!

<pre><code>Producing Kafka person event: {""lastName"": ""Doe"", ""firstName"": ""John""}
</code></pre>

<p>When I use the Kafka Topics UI browser from my docker Kafka environment, see <a href=""https://hub.docker.com/r/landoop/fast-data-dev/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://hub.docker.com/r/landoop/fast-data-dev/</a>, and view the message raw data it is different in both cases.</p>

<p>It looks more correct for Spring Kafka as the browser recognises and displays the fields inside the message value.</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    ""topic"": ""test_spring_kafka"",
    ""key"": ""3197449393600061094"",
    ""value"": {
      ""lastName"": ""Doe"",
      ""firstName"": ""John""
    },
    ""partition"": 0,
    ""offset"": 0
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>In the Spring Cloud Stream Kafka raw data the browser fails to recognise the fields which shows that the messages are not the same.</p>

<pre><code>[
  {
    ""topic"": ""test_spring_cloud_kafka"",
    ""key"": ""-6214497758709596999"",
    ""value"": ""\u0006Doe\bJohn"",
    ""partition"": 0,
    ""offset"": 0
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>I think there may be an issue producing the Confluent messages using Spring Cloud Stream Kafka and that the Spring Kafka implementation is producing them correctly but maybe I am missing something in my implementation and some one could help me with this problem?</p>

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence

AI is a trending buzzword in the business world and has a bit of mysticism
associated with it due to the different contexts where it is being mentioned.
Let us try to understand it in a little bit more detail

Intelligence is the mental ability to reason, solve problems and learn. This
is a cognitive function associated with the Brain. Artificial intelligence is
the field of study that focuses on building machines that can mimic human
intelligence

3 levels of artificial intelligence are

1) **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)** â AI that specializes in one area.
Google AlphaGo that beat Lee Sedol in 2016 is an example

2) **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** â This is also known as human
level AI which is proficient in multiple areas. We are yet to reach this stage
of evolution

3) **Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)** â AI thinker Nick Bostrom defines
superintelligence as âan intellect that is much smarter than the best human
brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general
wisdom and social skills.â

> In any evolution, the inflection points are the periods of significant
change. There are 2 inflection points in the AI evolution journey (1) ANI to
AGI and (2) AGI to ASI

 _AGI to ASI is commonly known as the Singularity point_. Singularity refers
to transformation from a finite predictable past to an infinite unpredictable
future. Ray Kurzweil predicts that this would happen sometime in 2045. So, let
us worry about that later since we got some time ð.

The focus here is the first inflection point from Artificial Narrow
Intelligence to Artificial General Intelligence. How is this being approached?
Humans use the five basic senses (touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste) to
perceive the world. Can we mimic this to create Artificial General
Intelligence? Significant progress has been made on this front

The sense organs for an AGI would be as follows

 **Eyes** â Cameras available in almost every device from desktops, laptops,
tablets and smartphones

 **Ears** â Always on microphones which have proliferated thanks to rapid
adoption of smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple HomePod

 **Skin** â The shift from type to touch based interface on devices helps
capture tactile response

 **Tongue** â The sense of taste that extends beyond just food is captured to
a great extent in the digital world (content consumption, past purchases,
etc.) and in the physical world through loyalty and payment cards/wallets

 **Nose** â As far as I know, the sense of smell is something which has not
yet been mastered

If a company manages to find a way to pass on the sense of smell to the
machine would that signify the transition to Artificial General Intelligence?

Well not so fast! There is a strong debate on whether our perception based
intelligence is just a sum of the parts (in this case the 5 senses) or is
there a Consciousness that acts as a master controller of these parts. The
jury is still out on this one and I am keenly watching this space!

Once messages are submitted to this thread pool your listener can load more data. You can control the concurrency by adjusting thread pool settings.</p>

<p>Your listener's method signature will be similar to one below:</p>

<pre><code>@SqsListener(value = ""${queueName}"", deletionPolicy = SqsMessageDeletionPolicy.NEVER)

<p>A worker thread then will acknowledge the successful processing</p>

<pre><code>acknowledgment.acknowledge().get();

School 21 and had a brief conversation with students. The President was
informed about the school by Head of Sberbank German Gref and school Principal
Svetlana Infimovskaya.

The students of the school can study the following areas: Algorithms,
Graphics, Mobile Development, Computer Security, Robot Technology, and
Artificial Intelligence to name a few. The school has 940 students today.
Every year 1,000 software specialists will graduate from the school. On
average, students are expected to study for 2â3.5 years. The course includes
two practical training sessions in relevant companies for six months or more.

 **Opening remarks at the meeting on the development of artificial
intelligence technologies**

 **President of Russia Vladimir Putin:** Good afternoon, colleagues.

Today I suggest that we discuss concrete steps that will form the foundation
for our National Strategy on the development of artificial intelligence
technologies. We have repeatedly spoken about the need for such a
comprehensive document. I also mentioned it in this yearâs Address to the
Federal Assembly. This is indeed one of the key areas of technological
development that determines and will continue to determine the future of the
entire world.

The artificial intelligence mechanisms will allow for quick real-time
decision-making based on analysing vast amounts of information known as big
data, which provides tremendous advantages in terms of quality and
performance. In addition, such mechanisms are unparalleled in history in terms
of their impact on the economy and productivity, the effectiveness of
management, education, healthcare and daily life.

However, vying for technological leadership, primarily, in the sphere of
artificial intelligence â and you are all very well aware of this, colleagues
â has already lead to global competition. New products and solutions are being
created at an exponential growth rate. I have said it before and I will say it
now: he who can establish a monopoly in artificial intelligence â we are aware
of the consequences â will rule the world.

It is no accident that many developed countries of the world have already
adopted action plans to develop such technologies. Of course, we must ensure
technological sovereignty in the realm of artificial intelligence. This is the
most important prerequisite for the viability of our businesses and the
economy, the quality of life for Russian citizens, security and, finally, our
defence capability. Here, we are not just talking about algorithms for
addressing individual and highly specialised problems; what we need are
universal solutions, the use of which gives the optimum effect in any
industry.

In order to achieve such an ambitious goal in AI technology, we are
objectively positioned to have a good start and we have a serious competitive
edge. Today, Russia boasts one of the worldâs highest penetration rates for
mobile communications and internet access, as well as for the development of
electronic services. The cost of internet service in Russia is one of the
lowest internationally. We also rely on traditionally strong scientific and
education schools in mathematics and physics and a competitive system of
training IT specialists. Incidentally, Russian students have won the
International Programming Contest for the eighth year in a row. This year, it
was a team from Moscow State University.

Strong scientific and applied competencies have already made it possible to
create original and, most importantly, commercially viable world-class devices
in Russia, including in such areas as computer vision and voice recognition.
We just saw this when our colleagues showed them to us, as well as cyber
security. We have five years to achieve leading positions in these areas.

Colleagues, what are the tasks that we need to focus on and prioritise in the
Strategy based on Russian and international experience, as well as global
trends? I will only list those that I believe should be a priority. I hope to
hear from you as well. This is why we have gathered here today. We need to
make the Strategy complete and effective.

The first priority is to lay conceptually new fundamental groundwork, create
mathematical methods and operation principles for artificial intelligence,
including those based on the human brain. Russia must become one of the key
platforms for solving the most complicated scientific problems involving
scientists from all over the world. This work could also be performed by the
international mathematics centres that will be opened in Moscow, St Petersburg
and Sochi next year, as you may recall. In fact, they will complement the
facilities we already have. It is necessary to multiply the funding for
artificial intelligence research and create incentives for private investment
and corporate science, research and development. We need to discuss this issue
specifically.

Second. We need to build our workforce and intellectual potential, retain our
talent and attract the best professionals from all over the world. There are
actually many people working in this industry in Russia, but still much fewer
than in the countries that are pursuing leadership in this area. To secure
this leadership, we need to develop study programmes in artificial
intelligence at universities and colleges, including those in the regions.

It is also important that we propose efficient mechanisms for monetary
incentives, comfortable working conditions, including remote work, for our
programmers, engineers and scientists and for the leading experts working
abroad who, as you know, include many Russians, and they are happy to return
to Russia and work with their colleagues here. Of course, when necessary, it
is important to expedite any formalities related to citizenship, work permits
and other requirements.

Third. It is absolutely important to bring our legislation up to date with the
new technological realities, to move quickly to take quality action to build a
flexible and adequate legal framework for developing and applying AI-based
solutions, as well as special regulations for private investment in
breakthrough solutions and, certainly, to guarantee solid protection of
intellectual property and legal conditions for patent registration in Russiaâs
national jurisdiction. I want to repeat that it is important to lift
legislative and administrative barriers for technological pioneering while
ensuring the security of the state and society with full observance of our
citizensâ rights. There is room for improvement.

Fourth. We need to build an efficient legal regulation for data circulation,
advanced infrastructure for data processing and storage as well as propose
balanced solutions that will allow using data for developing AI algorithms.
And, finally, the most important issue is whether our society and people are
ready for the pervasive implementation of this technology. It is necessary to
provide for mass digital literacy and re-training programmes â especially in
sought-after jobs.

Today Mr German Gref and I reviewed his school. It is indeed a great example
of specialist training and promotion of interesting, promising startups of
great significance for almost all sectors. So let us begin with this point.

__label__AI	Finding a Happy Home for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare - Artificial intelligence in hea https://t.co/wIcgVHBdQt #ai
__label__Cloud	"[An API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) provides a single entry
point for all the microservices running downstream. There are many gateway
solutions available such as [Zuul](https://github.com/Netflix/zuul),
[Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/), [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-
microservices-using-an-api-gateway/), etc. but in this article, we will
specifically discuss [Spring Cloud Gateway - a reactive
Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway) built upon Project
Reactor, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Boot 2.0.

First, we will start with an introduction of Spring Cloud Gateway and then
discuss the features of it that makes it the best fit as a cloud gateway.
After that, we will look into the gateway flow with different examples of
using predicates for routing, pre-filters, global filters to modify the
request and response header and body along with
[Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) support. In the end, we will
create a simple example project to demonstrate these capabilities with
discovery server using Netflix, multiple microservices and Spring Cloud
Gateway routing requests to these different microservices downstream.

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking Gateway

A Blocking gateway such as Zuul1 requires as many threads as no of requests to
handle requests coming to an API gateway and hence a lot of resources is
required to handle these requests. Any extra requests simply sit in the queue
and wait until a working thread completes its execution. Whereas in case of
non-blocking, the main thread is always available to serve the request and
other multiple threads process those requests asynchronously in the background
and once the request is completely processed the response is returned. Hence
non-blocking model requires a less no of resources to serve the same amount of
requests as compared to blocking gateway.

Here is an example of [spring cloud Netflix with Zuul as Gateway
Provider](https://www.devglan.com/spring-cloud/spring-netflix-zuul).

Spring cloud gateway is a non-blocking reactive gateway similar to Zuul2 but
spring cloud does not provide any out of the box integration with Zuul2.

Here is the [performance benchmark of Spring Cloud
gateway](https://github.com/spencergibb/spring-cloud-gateway-bench).

## Spring Cloud Gateway Architecture

Below is a simple architecture diagram of Spring Cloud. In the later sections,
we will discuss the different components involved in it.

![spring-cloud-gateway-architecture](https://i.imgur.com/2N8AgtH.png)

Once a request reaches to the gateway, the first thing gateway does is to
match the request with each of the available route based on the predicate
defined. Once, the route has matched the request moves to web handler and the
filters will be applied to the request. There are many out of the box filters
provided by the gateway itself to modify the request header as well as the
body. Pre-filters are applied specifically to a route whereas global filters
can be applied to all the route request. Global filters can be applied to
perform authentication and authorization of all the request at one place.

Once the response is generated by the downstream service, the post filter can
be used to modify the response such as to apply checksum in the response
header to all the responses to ensure the response is not tempered due to
middle man attack.

Below is an example of a route that has a predicate defined to match all the
request URL with `/api/v1/queue/**` and apply a pre-filter to rewrite the
path. There is another filter applied to modify the request header and then
route the request to load balanced FIRST-SERVICE.



    builder.routes()
                    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")
                            .filters(f -> f.rewritePath(""/api/v1/first/(?.*)"", ""/${remains}"")
                                            .addRequestHeader(""X-first-Header"", ""first-service-header"")
                            )
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced
                            .id(""queue-service""))

                    .build();


Below is the equivalent .yaml configuration.



    spring:
      cloud:
        gateway:
          routes:
          - id: first-service
            uri: lb://FIRST-SERVICE
            predicates:
            - Path=/api/v1/first/**
            filters:
            - RewritePath=/api/v1/first/(?.*), /$\{remains}
            - AddRequestHeader=X-first-Header, first-service-header



## Handler Mapping

This is the first component where all the requests hit. Handler mapping looks
into each route that is defined and tries to match with each predicate defined
in the route. After the match, handler mapping routes the request to that
matched route.

In the above example, we have only defined a path predicate to match the
request. There are a couple of other predicates out of the box to define our
route such as Host, Date/Time, Method, Headers, Query Params, Cookies, body
etc.

### Path Roue Predicate

With path predicate, we can match the request with URI path. For example,
below route is matched against the URl - localhost:8080/api/v1/first/users and
routes to load balanced first-service service.



    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")
                            .id(""first-service""))

                    .build();


### Host Route Predicate

With the Host route predicate, we can match Host header with any given
pattern.



    .route(r -> r.host(""**.devglan.com"")
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced
                            .id(""first-service""))

                    .build();


### Date/Time Route Predicate

This predicate can be used to match the route request with any given
date/time. We can use Before, After or Between to match with the date/time.



    .route(r -> r.before(ZonedDateTime.now())
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced
                            .id(""first-service""))

                    .build();


### Method Route Predicate

With this predicate, we match the HTTP request method type such as GET, POST,
etc.



    .route(r -> r.method(HttpMethod.POST)
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced
                            .id(""first-service""))

                    .build();


### Header Route Predicate

Header route predicate is used to match the request with the header params.



    .route(r -> r.header(""X-first-Header"", ""first-service-header"")
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced
                            .id(""first-service""))
                    .build();


### Query Param Route Predicate

This route predicate is used to match the request with query parameter passed
in the request URI.



    .route(r -> r.query(""refer"", ""email"")
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"") //downstream endpoint  lb - load balanced
                            .id(""first-service""))
                    .build();


### Cookies Route Predicate

The Cookie Route Predicate Factory takes two parameters, the cookie name and a
regular expression. This predicate matches cookies that have the given name
and the value matches the regular expression.



    .route(r -> r.cookie(""chocolate"", ""ch.p"")
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")
                            .id(""first-service""))
                    .build();


## Web Handler Filters

As discussed above, we can have pre-filters, global filters and post-flters.
There are many filters that are provided by the gateway out of the box and it
also provides flexibility to define our custom filters that can be either
applied to a specific route or to all the request coming to the gateway.

### Pre-Filters

Pre-filters are route specific which can be used to modify all the elements of
the incoming request such as Headers, Path, Rate Limiting, Cookies, Hystrix,
Moddify Body etc.

#### AddRequestHeader WebFilter

This filter is used to add extra header element in the incoming request. It
takes a name and value parameter.



    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")
                            .filters(f -> f.addRequestHeader(""X-first-Header"", ""first-service-header""))
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")
                            .id(""first-service""))
                    .build();


#### RewritePath WebFilter

It is used to rewrite the incoming request URI path. The RewritePath
GatewayFilter Factory takes a path regexp parameter and a replacement
parameter. This uses Java regular expressions for a flexible way to rewrite
the request path. Below is the Java config.



    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")
                            .filters(f -> f.rewritePath(""/api/v1/first/(?.*)"", ""/${remains}""))
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")
                            .id(""first-service""))
                    .build();


#### Rate Limiting WebFilter

It is mainly used to control the amount of incoming request to the server.This
filter uses a RateLimiter implementation to determine if the current request
is allowed to proceed. If it is not, a status of HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests
(by default) is returned.This filter takes an optional keyResolver parameter
and parameters specific to the rate limiter - replenishRate, capacity, and
keyResolverName

**ReplenishRate** \- Defines number of requests per second allowed.

**Capacity** \- Defines bursting capacity that is allowed. 2 consecutive
bursts will result in dropped requests (HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests)

**KeyResolverName** \- Custom implementation of KeyResolver interface.



    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")
                            .filters(f -> f.requestRateLimiter().configure(c -> c.setRateLimiter(customRateLimiter)))
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")
                            .id(""first-service""))
                    .build();


Here, customRateLimiter is the implementation of KeyResolver interface.

#### Hystrix WebFilter

The Hystrix GatewayFilter allows you to introduce circuit breakers to your
gateway routes, protecting your services from cascading failures and allowing
you to provide fallback responses in the event of downstream failures. The
Hystrix GatewayFilter Factory requires a single name parameter, which is the
name of the HystrixCommand.



    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")
                            .filters(f -> f.hystrix(h -> h.setName(""Hystrix"").setFallbackUri(""forward:/fallback"")))
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")
                            .id(""first-service""))
                    .build();



    @RestController
    @RequestMapping(""/fallback"")
    public class FallbackController {

        @GetMapping(""/"")
        public ResponseEntity fallback(){
            return ResponseEntity.ok(Arrays.asList());
        }
    }


#### Modify Request Body Filter

This filter can be used to modify the request body before it is sent
downstream by the Gateway.



    @Bean
    public RouteLocator routes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
        return builder.routes()
            .route(""rewrite_request_obj"", r -> r.host(""*.rewriterequestobj.org"")
                .filters(f -> f.prefixPath(""/httpbin"")
                    .modifyRequestBody(String.class, Hello.class, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE,
                        (exchange, s) -> return Mono.just(new Hello(s.toUpperCase())))).uri(uri))
            .build();
    }

    static class Hello {
        String message;

        public Hello() { }

        public Hello(String message) {
            this.message = message;
        }

        public String getMessage() {
            return message;
        }

        public void setMessage(String message) {
            this.message = message;
        }
    }


### Global Filter

Global filters cana be applied conditionally to all routes. The different
global filters are Netty Router, Web Sockets, Load Balancer, Metrics.

### Post Filters

Post filters are used to add, modify, remove or rewrite response header or
body.

#### Add Response Header Filter



    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")
                            .filters(f -> f.addResponseHeader(""payload-size"", ""12""))
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")
                            .id(""first-service""))
                    .build();



#### Remove Response Header Filter



    .route(r -> r.path(""/api/v1/first/**"")
                            .filters(f -> f.removeResponseHeader(""payload-size""))
                            .uri(""lb://FIRST-SERVICE/"")
                            .id(""first-service""))
                    .build();


## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed about the spring cloud gateway and its different
components such as routes, predicates, filters with example. In the next
tutorial of [Spring Cloud Gateway Example](https://www.devglan.com/spring-
cloud/spring-cloud-gateway-example) we will implement these theories and build
an application with microservice architecture using Spring Cloud Gateway and
demonstrate working examples on web filters to modify request and response
body.

__label__AI	"# Artificial Intelligence will Enhance and Hack Humanity

The truth is, itâs complicated and will become even more complicated. AI is
already being used to hack us in multiple ways, from us gifting our data and
private info to technology firms to how our attention on our mobile devices is
funneled.

The internet has created new pillars that monetizes the future where AI isnât
just not regulated, it hasnât even hit its stride in how ubiquitous it will
become.

  * Attention economy
  * Surveillance capitalism
  * AI in driving global GDP
  * AI in cybersecurity
  * AIâs role in technological loneliness (âdivide and conquer in the smart homeâ)

If AI has become the new âarms raceâ between the likes of the U.S and China,
we stand at the dawn of a new era where [AI will both
enhance](https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-kai-fu-lee-fei-fei-li-artificial-
intelligence/) and hack us in ways we cannot yet imagine.

After reading [Jun Wu](https://medium.com/@junwu_46652)âs piece on [Empathy in
Artificial Intelligence](https://towardsdatascience.com/empathy-in-artificial-
intelligence-eb167f62af99), it got me thinking. Male bias and the
militarization of AI is very dangerous for humanity. Itâs probably an
existential threat to our survival as a species. I donât just mean this in the
Elon Musk terms of AGI, but in how we fail to regulate it.

#### China will Lead Ethics in AI in the 21st Century

As China rises to dominance both technologically and economically that will
become more pronounced in the 2030s, their approach to ethics in AI will begin
to dominate the world. We can already tell that they will be the leaders in
how facial recognition informs universal systems of surveillance, the
manifestation of social credit systems and the monetization of data in Asia.

  * Facial recognition and its ethical implications.
  * AI in the rise of Universal Surveillance Architecture Systems (USAS)
  * Emergence of Social Credit Systems
  * Monetization of data in Asia

[China is best
positioned](https://www.ft.com/content/f92abc38-6bb8-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d)
in the future to influence and impact policy regarding the regulation of AI.
They have started to think seriously about the [ethics of
AI.](https://www.scmp.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) Their thinking is
not yet mature, but if China can be a leader globally in any signal way that
is most important to the future of humanity, itâs on the [regulation & ethics
of AI](https://www.scmp.com/business/commodities/article/2157700/ethics-and-
pursuit-artificial-intelligence).

Before that happens they will likely make a lot of mistakes and serious
breaches of AI ethics, and its impact on things like human rights.

#### The Age of Biotechnology & AI is an Ethical Minefield

Wired recently interviewed Fei-Fei Li, you can read the interview
[here](https://www.wired.com/story/will-artificial-intelligence-enhance-hack-
humanity/). Here are some bullet points from that event:

  * The era of Biotechnology will allow people to hack their humanity in ways that were never possible before.
  * AI will be deeply implicated in how we hack other humans and alter even our DNA.
  * The era of AI and biotech enhancements is coming, so the question is, who decides what is a good enhancement and what is a bad enhancement?
  * YNH: _The easiest people to manipulate are the people who believe in free will, because they think they cannot be manipulated._

An awesome debate. Yuval Noah Harari & Fei-Fei Li

### The 4th Industrial Revolution

  * In the 4th industrial revolution is an era of great convenience and major ethical questions that could lead to irreparable damage in how we evolve as a species (it could lead to our extinction).
  * What are the good qualities we need to enhance? What happens when our military is automated and robotic? Is enhancing ourselves with AI dangerous?
  * The technological pressure of innovation for monetization also means powerful corporations could easily become too powerful where they place corporate profits ahead of ethical considerations. In 2019, we already have a long list of such occurrences.
  * There is already a crisis between engineers and their managers playing itself out at companies such as Google (and many other $1 Trillion dollar firms). The employees of BigTech are speaking out, with mixed results regarding the ethics of the work they are doing. AI is nearly always implicated in this.

#### Enhancing Means Hacking Humanity

As companies like Amazon and Google invade the smart home, our private data
and health data will become a major issue in the ethics of AI. This is because
simultaneously these companies will become giants in the AI of the future of
healthcare.

  * Google itself launched and[ dissolved its own AI ethics board](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18296113/google-ai-ethics-board-ends-controversy-kay-coles-james-heritage-foundation) due to major controversy surrounding it.
  * In 2019, the debate about ethics in AI also centers on if putting _Advertising_ at the center of the internet is healthy for the world. Facebook & Google among others are implicated in this on-going debate.

Apple and Facebook are pivoting into privacy architectures and walled gardens
based on subscription revenue (Apple) and the monetization of encrypted Chat
(Facebook).

The advent of artificial intelligence forces humanity, both governments and
the corporate sector to organize rules and guidelines on artificial
intelligence, bio-technologies and robots that protects the fate of the
species. Realistically this will take decades to find a global consensus on.

### The 2020s are a âBlack Mirrorâ decade for Ethics in AI

Before that takes place thereâs a period where hacking (rather than enhancing)
human becomes the wild-wild west of cybersecurity invasion. You can think of
smartphone addiction and mobile app engineering as part of this stage.

Fines against companies like Google & Facebook for monopolistic and privacy
data infractions are slow and relatively minor compared to the scale,
influence and power of these firms and the utilities they provide.

#### Artificial General Intelligence

The possibility of AGI manifesting in the 21st century is low, but still an
existential threat to humanity. More important that how humanity deals with
other life forms in our galaxy, guidelines for how to deal with AGI should it
ever manifest needs also to be constructed. As for artificial intelligence in
the current era, itâs impossible to regulate.

We need better AI to moderate and regulate AI. Itâs exponential growth in how
machine intelligence and algorithms are impacting us is a very difficult topic
considering the lack of checks and balances in capitalism. Itâs likely that
the 2020s are a very messy decade in terms of how humanity is hacked by
corporations. It could realistically lead to a surveillance architecture that
our parents might easily consider a dystopia.

As [my research

advent of digital repression is profoundly affecting [the relationship between
citizen and state](https://doi.org/10.1353/jod.2019.0003). New technologies
are arming governments with unprecedented capabilities to monitor, track and
surveil individual people. Even governments in democracies with strong

In states with [unaccountable institutions and frequent human rights

likely cause greater damage. China is a prominent example. Its leadership has

Its exploitation of these technologies [presents a chilling
model](https://www.georgesoros.com/2019/01/24/remarks-delivered-at-the-world-

democratic societies. Although thereâs no evidence that other governments have
replicated this level of AI surveillance, Chinese companies are actively
exporting the same underlying technologies across the world.

systems](https://ai.stanford.edu/%7Enilsson/QAI/qai.pdf) are everywhere in the
modern world, helping run smartphones, internet search engines, digital voice
assistants and Netflix movie queues. [Many people fail to
realize](https://governanceai.github.io/US-Public-Opinion-Report-Jan-2019/)
how quickly AI is expanding, thanks to ever-increasing amounts of data to be
analyzed, improving algorithms and advanced computer chips.

Any time more information becomes available and analysis gets easier,
governments are interested â and not just authoritarian ones. In the U.S., for
instance, the 1970s saw revelations that government agencies â such as the
FBI, CIA and NSA â had set up [expansive domestic surveillance
networks](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/94755_II.pdf)
to monitor and harass civil rights protesters, political activists and Native
American groups. These issues havenât gone away: Digital technology today has
deepened the ability of even more agencies to conduct even more intrusive
surveillance.

How fairly do algorithms predict where police should be most focused? [Arnout
de
Vries](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Criminaliteits_Anticipatie_Systeem.png)

For example, U.S. police have eagerly embraced AI technologies. They have
begun using software that is [meant to predict where crimes will
happen](https://theconversation.com/why-big-data-analysis-of-police-activity-
is-inherently-biased-72640) to decide where to send officers on patrol.
Theyâre also using [facial recognition](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-
news/facial-recognition-gives-police-powerful-new-tracking-tool-it-s-n894936)
and [DNA analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2018/12/13/fbi-
plans-rapid-dna-network-quick-database-checks-arrestees/) in criminal
investigations. But analyses of these systems show the [data on which those
systems are trained](https://theconversation.com/congress-takes-first-steps-
toward-regulating-artificial-intelligence-104373) are often biased, leading to
[unfair outcomes](https://theconversation.com/did-artificial-intelligence-
deny-you-credit-73259), such as [falsely determining that African Americans
are more likely to commit crimes](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-
bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) than other groups.

## AI surveillance around the world

In authoritarian countries, AI systems can directly abet domestic control and
surveillance, helping [internal security forces process massive amounts of
information](https://www.power3point0.org/2018/01/25/hybrid-repression-online-
and-offline-in-china-foretelling-the-human-rights-struggle-to-come/) â
including social media posts, text messages, emails and phone calls â more
quickly and efficiently. The police can identify social trends and [specific
people](https://www.apnews.com/bf75dd1c26c947b7826d270a16e2658a) who might
threaten the regime based on the information uncovered by these systems.

For instance, the Chinese government has used AI in wide-scale crackdowns in
regions that are home to ethnic minorities within China. Surveillance systems
in Xinjiang and Tibet have been described as
â[Orwellian](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/19/962492-orwell-china-
socialcredit-surveillance/).â These efforts have included [mandatory DNA
samples](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/china-xinjiang-uighur-
dna-thermo-fisher.html), Wi-Fi network monitoring and widespread facial
recognition cameras, all connected to integrated data analysis platforms. With
the aid of these systems, Chinese authorities have, according to the U.S.
State Department, âarbitrarily detainedâ between [1 and 2 million
people](https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2018&dlid=289037#wrapper).

My [research looks at 90 countries around the
world](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3374575) with
government types ranging from closed authoritarian to flawed democracies,
including Thailand, Turkey, Bangladesh and Kenya. I have found that Chinese
companies are [exporting AI surveillance
technology](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/01/22/we-need-to-get-smart-
about-how-governments-use-ai-pub-78179) to at least 54 of these countries.
Frequently, this technology is packaged as part of Chinaâs flagship [Belt and
Road Initiative](https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/), which is funding an extensive
network of roads, railways, energy pipelines and telecommunications networks
[serving 60% of the worldâs
population](https://www.knightfrank.com/blog/2018/01/30/an-insight-into-the-
belt-and-road-initiative) and economies that generate 40% of global GDP.

For instance, Chinese companies like
[Huawei](https://e.huawei.com/us/solutions/industries/smart-city) and ZTE are
constructing âsmart citiesâ in [Pakistan](https://www.dawn.com/news/1333101),
[the Philippines](https://e.huawei.com/en/case-
studies/global/2017/201704261658) and
[Kenya](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2017-05/16/content_29372143.htm),
featuring extensive built-in surveillance technology. For example, Huawei has
outfitted [Bonifacio Global City](https://bgc.com.ph/) in the Philippines with
high-definition internet-connected cameras that provide â[24/7 intelligent
security surveillance](https://e.huawei.com/en/case-
studies/global/2017/201704261658) with data analytics to detect crime and help
manage traffic.â

Bonifacio Global City in the Philippines has a lot of embedded surveillance
equipment. [alveo land/Wikimedia

[Hikvision](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/06/13/in-chinas-far-west-companies-
cash-in-on-surveillance-program-that-targets-muslims/),
[Yitu](https://www.scmp.com/tech/social-gadgets/article/2142497/malaysian-
police-wear-chinese-start-ups-ai-camera-identify) and
[SenseTime](https://qz.com/1248493/sensetime-the-billion-dollar-alibaba-
backed-ai-company-thats-quietly-watching-everyone-in-china/) are supplying
state-of-the-art facial recognition cameras for use in places like
[Singapore](https://www.albawaba.com/news/china%E2%80%99s-newest-global-
export-policing-dissidents-1139230) â which announced the establishment of a
surveillance program with [110,000 cameras mounted on lamp
posts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-surveillance/singapore-to-
test-facial-recognition-on-lampposts-stoking-privacy-fears-idUSKBN1HK0RV)
around the city-state. Zimbabwe is creating a [national image
database](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/24/beijings-big-brother-tech-
needs-african-faces/) that can be used for facial recognition.

However, selling advanced equipment for profit is different than sharing
technology with an express geopolitical purpose. These new capabilities may
plant the seeds for global surveillance: As governments become increasingly
dependent upon Chinese technology to manage their populations and maintain
power, they will face greater pressure to align with Chinaâs agenda. But for
now it appears that Chinaâs primary motive is to dominate the market for new
technologies and make lots of money in the process.

## AI and disinformation

In addition to providing surveillance capabilities that are both sweeping and
fine-grained, AI can help repressive governments manipulate available
information and spread disinformation. These campaigns can be automated or
automation-assisted, and deploy [hyper-personalized
messages](https://theconversation.com/solving-the-political-ad-problem-with-
transparency-85366) directed at â or against â [specific
people](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/us/politics/saudi-image-campaign-
twitter.html) or groups.

AI also underpins the technology commonly called
â[deepfake](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612501/inside-the-world-of-ai-
that-forges-beautiful-art-and-terrifying-deepfakes/),â in which algorithms
create [realistic video and audio
forgeries](https://theconversation.com/detecting-deepfake-videos-in-the-blink-
of-an-eye-101072). Muddying the waters between truth and fiction may become
useful in a tight election, when one candidate could create fake videos
showing an opponent doing and saying things that never actually happened.

VIDEO An early deepfake video shows some of the dangers of advanced
technology.

In my view, policymakers in democracies should think carefully about the risks
of AI systems to their own societies and to people living under authoritarian
regimes around the world. A critical question is how many countries will adopt
Chinaâs model of digital surveillance. But itâs not just authoritarian
countries feeling the pull. And itâs also not just Chinese companies spreading
the technology: Many U.S. companies, Microsoft included, but [IBM, Cisco and
Thermo Fisher](https://www.axios.com/china-us-technology-surveillance-
state-5672b822-fdde-45f9-ac77-e7b5574e9351.html) too, have provided
sophisticated capabilities to nasty governments. The misuse of AI is not
limited to autocratic states.

__label__Cloud	"<p>This should be fairly straight forward to explain. There are two concerns here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spring Cloud Gateway</li>
<li>Spring Security (LDAP)</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of the gateway segment is like any other part of a web-application. Don't so much worry about that part.</p>

<p>As far as getting spring-security + LDAP, you'll have to get that part worked out and configured as per your requirements then just make sure that the spring-cloud-gateway functionality is caught underneath the authentication filter.</p>

<p>If you're using spring-boot, probably would need the starters for sgc and spring-security. They should be fairly well documented and straight forward to configure.</p>

<p>The LDAP functionality in spring-security is very mature and should be easy enough to configure with little effort. Most of the functionality underpinning that (LDAP) is all implemented via the JRE.</p>

The first question was which platforms of MCM's are available? Which platforms are existing. I have to investigate the different properties and approaches from this platforms.</p>

<p>My first thought was, are there any platforms? Because I think there are none yet. In my opinion there are many different solutions on how to build or how to design MCM's, but no finished solution.</p>

<p>The next point was, what does MCM platform mean? Because middlewares are described as a platform of complex software system, which used as service to loosely couple other software components for file exchange. Maybe there is a better definition, but middleware could be seen as a platform. So the origin question is not which Mobile Cloud Middleware Platforms are available or existing, rather whcih Mobile Cloud Middlewares are available or existing, right? </p>

<p>Maybe I don`t understand the task. For what do I have to look for? Maybe there is an expert, who can give me an example or a good solution for mastering the task.</p>

__label__Cloud	"<p>So, with spring-cloud-stream 2.x we are gradually deprecating reactive module in favor of <a href=""https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spring-cloud-function</a> which provides reactive support out of the box. It's a much simpler and certainly less coupling programming model.

  <p>I'm working on a website and there is existing auth using Google cloud
  Datastore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your current auth system is generating your own OAuth tokens, you cannot use those tokens with Google Cloud Endpoints. You must generate your tokens via Google mechanisms (Google Accounts). Otherwise, Google services cannot validate your tokens.</p>

<p>The following assumes Google issued OAuth tokens.</p>

<p>Yes, it is possible and very easy. I will show you an example.</p>

<p>Note: I wrote an article on how to generate OAuth 2.0 Tokens with <code>CURL</code> including the Client ID token. <a href=""https://www.jhanley.com/google-oauth-2-0-testing-with-curl-refresh-access-token/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google OAuth 2.0 â Testing with Curl â Refresh Access Token</a> My article shows you the steps so that you can code in any language.</p>

<p>Using the CLI, generate an OAuth 2.0 Client ID Token:</p>

<pre><code>gcloud config config-helper --format ""value(credential.id_token)"" --force-auth-refresh
</code></pre>

<p>Save the generated token. Call it TOKEN for this example.</p>

<p>URL is the endpoint URL.</p>

<p>Now make a request to your endpoint:</p>

<pre><code>curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"" URL
</code></pre>

<p>If you are curious to see what is inside the TOKEN JWT:</p>

<p>curl <a href=""https://oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo?id_token=TOKEN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo?id_token=TOKEN</a></p>

<p>The returned JSON will look like this:</p>
